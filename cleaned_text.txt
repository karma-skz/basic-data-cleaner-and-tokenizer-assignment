most ecstatic moments, husband and wife are elevated far above worldly cares. everything else is closed away. this is the ideal. but marriage experts say that such mutual contribution and mutual joy are seldom achieved. instead one partner or the other dominates the sexual relationship. in the past, it has been the husband who has been dominant and the wife passive. but today there are signs that these roles are being reversed. in a growing number of american homes, marriage counselors report, the wife is taking a commanding role in sexual relationships. it is she who decides the time, the place, the surroundings, and the frequency of the sexual act. it is she who says aye or nay to the intimate questions of sexual technique and mechanics  not the husband. the whole act is tailored to her pleasure, and not to theirs. beyond a certain point, of course, no woman can be dominant  nature has seen to that. but there is little doubt that in many marriages the wife is boss of the marital bed. of course, there remain many" oldfashioned" marriages in which the husband maintains his supremacy. yet even in these marriages, psychologists say, wives are asserting themselves more strongly. the meekest, most submissive wife of today is a tiger by her mother's or grandmother's standards. to many experts, this trend was inevitable. they consider it simply a sign of our times. our society has" emancipated" the woman, giving her new independence and new authority. it is only natural that she assert herself in the sexual role." the sexual relationship does not exist in a vacuum", declares dr. mary steichen calderone, medical director of the planned parenthood federation of america and author of the recent book, release from sexual tensions." it reflects what is going on in other areas of the marriage and in society itself. a world in which wives have taken a more active role is likely to produce sexual relationships in which wives are more selfassertive, too". yet many psychologists and marriage counselors agree that domination of the sex relationship by one partner or the other can be unhealthy and even dangerous. it can, in fact, wreck a marriage. when a husband is sexually selfish and heedless of his wife's desires, she is cheated of the fulfillment and pleasure nature intended for her. and she begins to regard him as savage, bestial and unworthy. on the other hand, wifely supremacy demeans the husband, saps his selfrespect, and robs him of his masculinity. he is a target of ridicule to his wife, and often  since private affairs rarely remain private  to the outside world as well." a marriage can survive almost any kind of stress except an open and direct challenge to the husband's maleness", declares dr. calderone. this opinion is supported by one of the nation's leading psychiatrists, dr. maurice e. linden, director of the mental health division of the philadelphia department of public health." when the roles of husband and wife are reversed, so that the wife becomes leader and the husband follower", dr. linden says," the effects on their whole relationship, sexual and otherwise, can be disastrous". in one extreme case, cited by a pittsburgh psychologist, an office worker's wife refused to have sexual relations with her husband unless he bought her the luxuries she demanded. to win her favors, her husband first took an additional job, then desperately began to embezzle from his employer. caught at last, he was sentenced to prison. while he was in custody his wife divorced him. more typical is the case of a suburban long island housewife described by a marriage counselor. this woman repeatedly complained she was" too tired" for marital relations. to please her, her husband assumed some of the domestic chores. finally, he was cooking, washing dishes, bathing the children, and even ironing  and still his wife refused to have relations as often as he desired them. one wife, described by a new york psychologist, so dominated her husband that she actually placed their sexual relationship on a schedule, writing it down right between the weekly pta meetings and the thursdaynight neighborhood card parties. another put sex on a dollarsandcents basis. after every money argument, she rebuffed her husband's overtures until the matter was settled in her favor. experts say the partners in marriages like these can almost be typed. the wife is likely to be young, sophisticated, smart as a whip  often a girl who has sacrificed a promising career for marriage. she knows the power of the sex urge and how to use it to manipulate her husband. the husband is usually a welleducated professional, preoccupied with his job  often an organization man whose motto for getting ahead is:" do not rock the boat". sometimes this leads to his becoming demandingly dominant in marriage. hemmed in on the job and unable to assert himself, he uses the sex act so he can be supreme in at least one area. more often, though, he is so accustomed to submitting to authority on the job without argument that he lives by the same rule at home. some psychologists, in fact, suggest that careerbound husbands often are more to blame for topsyturvy marriages than their wives. the wife's attempt at control, these psychologists contend, is sometimes merely a pathetic effort to compel her husband to pay as much attention to her as he does to his job. naturally no woman can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative. unless her husband also desires sex, the act cannot be consummated. generally, however, in such marriages as those cited, the husband is at his wife's mercy." the pattern", says dr. morton schillinger, psychologist at new york's lincoln institute for psychotherapy," is for the husband to hover about anxiously and eagerly, virtually trembling in his hope that she will flash him the signal that tonight is the night". no one seriously contends, of course, that the domineering wife is, sexually speaking, a new character in our world. after all, the henpecked husband with his shrewish wife is a comic figure of long standing, in literature and on the stage, as dr. schillinger points out. there is no evidence that these milquetoasts became suddenly emboldened when they crossed the threshhold of the master bedroom. furthermore, dr. calderone says, a certain number of docile, retiring men always have been around. they are not" frigid" and they are not homosexual;; they are just restrained in all of life. they like to be dominated. one such man once confided to dr. theodor reik, new york psychiatrist, that he preferred to have his wife the sexual aggressor. asked why, he replied primly:" because that is no activity for a gentleman". but such cases were, in the past, unusual. society here and abroad has been built around the dominating male  even the bible appears to endorse the concept. family survival on our own western frontier, for example, could quite literally depend on a man's strength and ability to bring home the bacon;; and the dependent wife seldom questioned his judgment about anything, including the marriage bed. this carried over into the more urbanized late 19th and early 20th centuries, when the man ruled the roost in the best bullroaring life with father manner. in those days, a wife had mighty few rights in the domestic sphere and even fewer in the sexual sphere." grandma was not expected to like it", dr. marion hilliard, the late toronto gynecologist, once summed up the attitude of the'90s. wives of the period shamefacedly thought of themselves as" used" by their husbands  and, history indicates, they often quite literally were. when was the turning point?? when did women begin to assert themselves sexually?? some date it from woman suffrage, others from when women first began to challenge men in the marketplace, still others from the era of the emancipated flapper and bathtub gin. virtually everyone agrees, however, that the trend toward female sexual aggressiveness was tremendously accelerated with the postwar rush to the suburbs. left alone while her husband was miles away in the city, the modern wife assumed more and more duties normally reserved for the male. circumstances gave her almost undisputed sway over childrearing, moneyhandling and home maintenance. she found she could cope with all kinds of problems for which she was once considered too helpless. she liked this taste of authority and independence, and, with darkness, was not likely to give it up." very few wives", says dr. calderone," who balance the checkbook, fix the car, choose where the family will live and deal with the tradesmen, are suddenly going to become submissive where sex is concerned. a woman who dominates other family affairs will dominate the sexual relationship as well". and an additional factor was helping to make women more sexually selfassertive  the comparatively recent discovery of the true depths of female desire and response. marriage manuals and women's magazine articles began to stress the importance of the female climax. they began to describe in detail the woman's capacity for response. in fact, the noted psychologist and sex researcher, dr. albert ellis, has declared flatly that women are" sexually superior" to men. according to dr. ellis, the average 20yearold american woman is capable of far greater sexual arousal than her partner. not surprisingly, dr. ellis says, some recently enlightened wives are out to claim these capabilities. yet, paradoxically, according to dr. maurice linden, many wives despise their husbands for not standing up to them. an aggressive woman wants a man to demand, not knuckle under." when the husband becomes passive in the face of his wife's aggressiveness", dr. linden says," the wife, in turn, finds him inadequate. often she fails to gain sexual satisfaction". one such wife, dr. linden says, became disgusted with her weak husband and flurried through a series of extramarital affairs in the hope of finding a stronger man. but her personality was such that each affair lasted only until that lover, too, had been conquered and reduced to passivity. then the wife bedhopped to the next on the list. in some cases, however, domination of the sex act by one partner can be temporary, triggered by a passing but urgent emotional need. thus a man who is butting a stone wall at the office may become unusually aggressive in bed  the one place he can still be champion. if his onthejob problems work out, he may return to his old pattern. sometimes a burst of aggressiveness will sweep over a man  or his wife  because he or she feels age creeping up. on the other hand, a husband who always has been vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive  asking, psychologists say, for reassurance that his wife still finds him desirable. or a wife may make sudden demands that she be courted, flattered or coaxed, simply because she needs her ego lifted. in any case, dr. calderone remarks, such problems are a couple's own affair, and cannot always be measured by a general yardstick." as long as the couple is in agreement in their approach to sex, it makes little difference if one or the other dominates", dr. calderone declares." the important point is that both be satisfied with the adjustment". other experts say, however, that if sexual domination by one or the other partner exists for longer than a brief period, it is likely to shake the marriage. and just as domination today often begins with the wife, so the cure generally must lie with the husband." to get a marriage back where it belongs", comments dr. schillinger of the lincoln institute," the husband must take some very basic steps. he must begin, paradoxically, by becoming more selfish. he must become more expressive of his own desires, more demanding and less" understanding". too many husbands, dr. schillinger continues, worry about" how well they are doing", and fear that their success depends on some trick or technique of sexual play. stones. sometimes the plough struck a hidden stone, and then the man was word to the seamen at the whip,

and even indecent  group from greenwich village to the embarcadero, he had become a suckerrolling freightjumper." there ai not nothin" faster, or lonelier, or more direct than a cannonball freight when you wanna go someplace", feathertop would say." the accommodations may not be the poshest, but man!! there ai not nobody askin" for your ticket stub, neither". he had been conning the freights for a long, long time now. ever since the hooch, and the trouble with the quartet, and midge and the child. ever since all that. it had been a very long time that had no form and no end. he was  as he told himself in the vernacular of a trade no longer his own  riding the dark train out. out and out and never to return again. till one day the last freight had been jumped, the last pint had been killed, the last beat had been rapped. that was the day it ended. the freight car was cold, early in the morning. he was pressed far back into the corner of the car on his hay sacks, the rattling and tinning of the wheels on the rails almost covering the sound of his ocarina. he held his elbows away from his body, and the little sweet potato trilled neatly and sweetly as he tickled its tunebelly. the train slowed at a road crossing, and the big door slid open;; at first gratingly, caught by grains of corn  then with a clash into its slot. the boy lifted the girl by the waist and set her on the lip of the floor. she pulled her legs up under her, to rise, her full peasant skirt drawing up her thighs, and feathertop's music pfffted away." now that is a very nice, a very nice", he murmured to himself, back in his corner. a little thing, but the right twist for the action that counted. hot, that was the word, hot!! hair like a morningfrightened sparrow's wings, with the sun shining down over them. a poet, yet!! his thoughts for the swanlike neck, the full, high breasts, the slim waist, and the long legs were less than poetic, however. zinggggo!! then the boy straightarmed himself up, twisting at the last moment so he landed sitting. he was less to see, but feathertop took him in, too, just to keep the records straight. curly hair, high cheekbones, wide gnomelike mouth, a pair of drummer's blocky hands, and a body that said well, maybe i can wrestle you for ten minutes  but then i am finished." we made it, cappy", the chick said." yeah, seems so, do not it", the boy laughed, hugging her close." ahah"!! feathertop interrupted, standing up, brushing the pig offal from his dirty pants." none of that. we run a respectable house here". they whirled and saw him, standing there dim in the slatted light from the boarded freight wall. he was big, and filthy, and his toes stuck out of the flapping tops of his shoes. he held the black plastic kazoo lightly." come sit", said feathertop, motioning them toward him." that crap is softer over here". the girl smiled, and started forward. the boy yanked her back hard, tugging her off her feet, and gathered her into the crook of his arm." now stay with me, kitty", he snapped irritably." i vowed to take care of you  and that is what i am gonna do. we do not know this guy"." oooo, square bit", feathertop screwed his face up. this guy was strictly from outsville. but nowhere!!" what is with this vow jazz"?? feathertop inquired, lounging against the freight's vibrating wall." we  we eloped", cappy said. his head came up and he said it defiantly." well, congratulations". feathertop made an elaborate motion with his hand. these two were going to be easy pickins. they could not have much dough, but then none of the freightbums feathertop rolled had much. and besides, the chick had a little something the others did not have. that was gonna be fun collecting!! but not just yet. feathertop was a connoisseur. he liked to savor his meat before he tasted it." come sit", he repeated, motioning to the piled hay bags, over the pig leavings." i am just a poor exjazz man, name of  uh  boyd smith". he grinned at them wolfishly." that ai not your name, mister", the boy accused." and you know  you are right"!! feathertop aimed a finger at him." oh, come on, cappy", the girl chided." he is okay. he is a nice guy". she started to move toward the hay bags, dragging the reluctant cappy behind her. feathertop watched the smooth scissoring of her slim, trim legs as she walked to the bags, and tucked them beneath her, smoothing the skirt out in a wide circle. he cleared his throat;; it had been a long, hot while since he would seen anything as nice as this within grabbin" distance. he had it all doped, of course. slug the kid, grab his dough  at least enough to get to philadelphia  and then have a rockin" ball with the doll. hmm  diddle!!" where would you come from, mr.  uh  mr. smith"?? kitty inquired politely." where from"?? he mused." out. i been riding train for a ways now". they lapsed into silence, and the freight wallowed up a hill, scooted down the other side, shaking and clanking to itself. after a while, kitty murmured something to cappy, and he held her close, answering," we will just have to wait till we pull into philly, honey"." what is the matter, she wanna go the bathroom"?? ernie found it immensely funny. the boy scowled at him, and the girl looked shocked." no!! certainly not, i mean, no that is not what i said"!! she snapped at him." i only said i was hungry. we have not had anything to eat all day". joviality suffused feathertop ernie cargill's voice as he reached behind him, pulling out a battered carpet bag, with leather handles." why not ya say so, fellow travelers!! why, we got dinner right here. c amon, buddy, help me set up the kitchen and we will have food in a minute or two". cappy looked wary, but he moved off the floorboards and followed the dirty exmusician to the center of the refuselittered boxcar. ernie crouched and opened the carpet bag. he took out a small packet filled with bits of charcoal, a deep pot of thin metal, some sheets of newspaper, a book of matches and a wrinkled and manytimes folded piece of tin foil with holes in it. he put the charcoal in the pot, lit the paper with the matches, and carefully stretched the tin foil across the top of the pot." a charcoal pit, man", he said, indicating the slightlysmoking makeshift brazier." fan it", he told cappy, handing him a sheet of newspaper." yeah, but what are we gonna eat?? charcoal"??" fella", ernie waggled a dirty finger at the younger man," you try my everlovin" patience". he reached once more into the carpet bag and brought up a package of wieners." hot dogs, man. not the greatest, but they stick to your belly insides". he ripped down the cellophane carefully, and laid three dogs on the tin foil. almost immediately they began to sizzle. he looked up and grinned." a kroger's selfserve", he explained." i selfserved". when they had licked the last of the wieners" taste from their fingers, they settled back, and cappy offered ernie a cigarette. nice kid, ernie thought, too bad." how come you are riding the rods, kids like you"?? ernie asked. cappy looked down at his wide hands, and did not reply. but surprisingly, kitty's face came up and she said," my father. he did not want us to get married. so we ran away"." why did not he want you to get hitched"?? this time even she did not answer. she looked down at her hands, too. after a few seconds, she said," dad did not like cappy. it was my fault". cappy's head came around sharply." your fault, hell!! it was all my fault. if i would been careful it never woulda"  he stopped abruptly. ernie's eyebrows went up." what is the matter"?? the girl still did not raise her eyes, but she added simply," i am pregnant". cappy raged at himself." oh he was stupid, her old man!! you never heard nothin" like it: kitty's gonna go have an abortion, and kitty's gonna go away to a convent, and kitty's this and kitty's that like he was nuts or somethin", y'know"?? ernie nodded. this was a slightly different matter. he remembered midge, and the child. but that had been a time before all this, a time he did not think about. a time before the white lightning and the bumming had turned him inside out. but these kids were not like him. oh crap!! he thought, pull out of it, old son. these are just another couple of characters to roll. what they got, you get. now forget all this other." wanna drink"?? ernie offered, taking the pint of sweet lucy from his jacket pocket." yeah. now that you offer". the answer came from the open door of the boxcar. from the man who had leaped in from the high bank outside, as the train had slowed on the grade. ernie stared at the man. he was big. real big, with shoulders out to here, and hair all over him like a grizzly. road gang, ernie thought." you gonna give me a drink, fella"?? the big man asked again, taking a step into the boxcar. ernie hesitated a moment. this character could break him in half." sure", he said, and lifted the pint to his own lips. he guzzled down threequarters of the strong homeblend and proffered the remainder. the man stalked toward them, his big boots heavy on the wooden flooring. he took the bottle with undue belligerence, and making sucking noises with his thick lips, drained it completely. he threw his head back, closed his eyes, and belched ferociously. he belched again, and opening his eyes, threw the bottle out the open door." well, now", he said, and reached into his pocket." i did not know i was gonna have company in this car"." we are going to philadelphia", kitty said, pulling her skirt down around her legs all the more." no, i do not think so", said the big man, and it was the final clincher for ernie. he had suspected this guy was trouble, and now he was sure of it." maybe you and me will, girlie, but these two ai not goin" nowhere". he advanced on them, and abruptly there was a shocked electricity in the car. ernie was screaming inside himself: no, damn you, you ai not gonna take my meal ticket away from me!! the newcomer stalked toward them, and kitty shied back, her hand to her mouth. her scream split up the silence of the car, accompanied by the rattling of the freight, and then cappy came off the floor, his legs driving him hard. the kid hit the bigger man with an audible thwump!! and carried him backward in a footballer's tackle. they went down in a heap and for a long minute there was nothing to see but flailing arms and legs. the kid showed for an instant, and his arm was cocked back. the fist went down into the pile of flesh, and ernie heard the bigger man's deeper voice go," aaawww"!! then they were tumbling again, and the big man reached into the same pocket he had gone for earlier, and came up with a vicious switchblade. he held the knife aloft an instant  an instant enough to press the stud. the blade came out with a snick!! he fisted the knife overhand, and drew back to plunge it into the kid's throat. kitty screamed insanely and her face was white. she grabbed at feathertop's sleeve and shrieked," help him!! help him!! do something"!! you mainly were stirr would vp? light the shadow of death. for his sake and her own, to do it well, that

manchester, bristol, edinburgh, limerick, from new jersey, morgan hastened to the headquarters of washington at whitemarsh, pennsylvania, arriving there on november 18th. there was much sickness in the corps, and the men were, in addition, without the clothing, shoes, and blankets needed for the winter weather. morgan himself had sciatica again. even on his tough constitution, the exposure and strenuous activity were beginning to tell in earnest. on the morning of november 17th, cornwallis and 2,000 men had left philadelphia with the object of capturing fort mercer at red bank, new jersey. in order to prevent this, washington hastened to dispatch several units to reinforce the fort, including a force under the marquis de lafayette containing some 160 of morgan's riflemen, all who were fit for duty at this time, the rest having no shoes. although the fort was evacuated in the face of the force of cornwallis, morgan and his men did have a chance to take another swing at the redcoats. a picket guard of about 350, mostly hessians, were attacked by the americans under lafayette, and driven back to their camp, some twenty to thirty of them falling before the riflemen's fire." i never saw men", lafayette declared in regard to the riflemen," so merry, so spirited, and so desirous to go on to the enemy, whatever force they might have, as that small party in this fight". nathanael greene told washington that" lafayette was charmed with the spirited behavior of the militia and riflemen". a few days later it was learned that general howe was planning an attack upon the american camp. the british general moved his forces north from philadelphia to chestnut hill, near the right wing of the patriot encampment. here the pennsylvania militia skirmished with the british, but soon fled. morgan was ordered to attack the enemy, who had meantime moved to edge hill on the left of the americans. similar orders were given to the maryland militia. morgan immediately disposed his troops for action and found he had not long to wait. a body of redcoats were seen marching down a nearby slope, a tempting target for the riflemen, who threw a volley into their ranks and" messed up" the smart formation considerably. now the riflemen and the marylanders followed up their beginning and closed in on the british, giving them another telling round of fire. the redcoats ran like rabbits. but the maryland militia had likewise fled, all too typical of this type of soldier during the revolution, an experience which gave morgan little confidence in militia in general, as he watched other instances of their breaking in hot engagements. the british, although suffering considerable losses, noted the defection of the marylanders, made a stand, then turned and attacked morgan who became greatly outnumbered and had to retire. the americans lost fortyfour men, among them major joseph morris of morgan's regiment, an officer who was regarded with high esteem and affection, not only by his commander, but by washington and lafayette as well. the latter was so upset on learning of the death of morris, that he wrote morgan a letter, showing his own warmhearted generosity. after complimenting morgan and the riflemen and saying he was praising them to congress, too, the ardent frenchman added he felt that congress should make some financial restitution to the widow and family of morris, but that he knew morgan realized how long such action usually required, if it was done at all." as mrs. morris may be in some want before that time", lafayette continued," i am going to trouble you with a commission which i beg you will execute with the greatest secrecy. if she wanted to borrow any sum of money in expecting the arrangements of congress, it would not become a stranger, unknown to her, to offer himself for that purpose. but you could  as from yourself  tell her that you had friends who, being with the army, do not know what to do with their money and would willingly let her have one or many thousand dollars". this was accordingly done, and the plight of the grateful mrs. morris was much relieved as a result of the generous loan, the amount of which is not known. apparently still sensitive about the idea with which general gates had approached him at saratoga, namely, that george washington be replaced, morgan was vehement in his support of the commanderinchief during the campaign around philadelphia. richard peters, secretary of the board of war, thought morgan was so extreme on the subject that he accused him of trying to pick a quarrel. morgan hotly denied this and informed the board of war that the men in camp linked the name of peters with the plot against washington. peters insisted that this impression was a great misunderstanding, and evidently, from the quarrel, obtained an unfavorable impression of morgan's judgment. such a situation regarding the board of war could hardly have helped morgan's chances for promotion when that matter came before the group later on. in late december, the american army moved from whitemarsh to valley forge, and although the distance was only 13 miles, the journey took more than a week because of the bad weather, the barefooted and almost naked men. the position of the new camp was admirably selected and well fortified, its easily defensible nature being one good reason why howe did not attack it. besides helping to prevent the movement of the british to the west, valley forge also obstructed the trade between howe's forces and the farmers, thus threatening the vital subsistence of the redcoats and rendering their foraging to obtain necessary supplies extremely hazardous. in order to see that this hindering situation remained effective, washington detached several bodies of his troops to the periphery of the philadelphia area. morgan and his corps were placed on the west side of the schuylkill river, with instructions to intercept all supplies found going to the city and to keep a close eye on the movements of the enemy. the headquarters of morgan was on a farm, said to have been particularly well located so as to prevent the farmers nearby from trading with the british, a practice all too common to those who preferred to sell their produce for british gold rather than the virtually worthless continental currency. in his dealings with offenders, however, morgan was typically firm but just. for example, he captured some persons from york county, who with teams were taking to philadelphia the furniture of a man who had just been released from prison through the efforts of his wife, and who apparently was helpless to prevent the theft of his household goods. morgan took charge of the furniture and restored it to its thankful owners, but he let the culprits who had stolen it go free. morgan complained to washington about the men detailed to him for scouting duty, most of them he said being useless." they straggle at such a rate", he told the commanderinchief," that if the enemy were enterprising, they might get two from us, when we would take one of them, which makes me wish general howe would go on, lest any incident happen to us". if the hardships of the winter at valley forge were trying for healthy men, they were, of course, much more so for those not in good health. daniel morgan's rheumatic condition worsened with the increase of the cold and damp weather. he had braved the elements and the enemy, but the strain, aided by the winter, was catching up with him at last. also, he was now fortythree years old. the mild activity of his command during the sojourn of the troops at valley forge could be handled by a subordinate, he felt, so like henry knox, equally loyal to washington, who went to boston at this time, morgan received permission to visit his home in virginia for several weeks. in his absence, the rifle regiment was under the command of major thomas posey, another able virginian. but morgan did not leave before he had written a letter to a william pickman in salem, massachusetts, apparently an acquaintance, praising washington and saying that the slanders propagated about him were" opposed by the general current of the people to exalt general gates at the expense of general washington was injurious to the latter. if there be a disinterested patriot in america,"tis general washington, and his bravery, none can question". it is doubtful if morgan was able to take home much money to his wife and children, for his pay, as shown by the war department abstracts of early 1778 was 75 a month as a colonel, and that apt to be delayed. he was shown a warm welcome regardless, and spent the time in winchester recuperating from his ailment, enjoying his family and arranging his private affairs which were, of course, run down. his neighbors celebrated his return, even if it was only temporary, and morgan was especially gratified by the quaint expression of an elderly friend, isaac lane, who told him," a man that has so often left all that is dear to him, as thou hast, to serve thy country, must create a sympathetic feeling in every patriotic heart". there must have been special feelings of joy and patriotism in the heart of daniel morgan too, when the news was received on april 30th of the recognition by france of the independence of the united states. his fellow virginian, george washington, had stated," i believe no event was ever received with more heartfelt joy". the dreary camp at valley forge was turned into an arena of rejoicing. even the dignified washington indulged in a game of wickets with some children. his soldiers on the whole did not celebrate so mildly. on may 6th, morgan, who had returned, received from washington orders to" send out patrols under vigilant officers" to keep near the enemy." the reason for this", the orders said," is that the enemy may think to take advantage of the celebration of this day. the troops must have more than the common quantity of liquor, and perhaps there will be some little drunkenness among them". apparently no serious disorders resulted from the celebration, and within a few days, morgan joined the force of lafayette who now had command of some 2,000 men at barren hill, not far above philadelphia on the schuylkill. the frenchman had been ordered to approach the enemy's lines, harass them and get intelligence of their movements. interestingly enough, the order transmitted to morgan through alexander hamilton also informed him that" a party of indians will join the party to be sent from your command at whitemarsh, and act with them". these were oneida indians. washington evidently was anxious for morgan to be cautious as well as aggressive, for on may 17th, 18th and 20th he admonished the leader of the riflemenrangers to be on the alert. obviously the commanderinchief had confidence that morgan would furnish him good intelligence too, for on the 23rd of may, he told morgan that the british were prepared to move, perhaps in the night, and asked morgan to have two of his best horses ready to dispatch to general smallwood with the intelligence obtained. meantime, however, this same general smallwood seemed to be serving chivalry as well as the american army. colonel benjamin ford wrote to morgan from wilmington that he understood a mrs. sanderson from maryland had obtained permission from smallwood to visit philadelphia, and would return on may 26th, escorted by several officers from maryland" belonging to the new levies in the british service". ford urged morgan to capture these men, who, he thought, might be disguised as quakers or peasants. morgan took the suggested steps, but when mrs. sanderson appeared, there was nobody with her but her husband, whom he promptly sent to headquarters to be questioned. but morgan evidently reported matters of intelligence much more important to his commanding general. a letter of a few days later from washington's aide to morgan stated," his excellency is highly pleased with your conduct upon this occasion". graffed in: for god is able to graff them in again. of their own descendant. 25:10 for in this mountain shall

was among these that hinkle identified a photograph of barco!! for it seems that barco, fancying himself a ladies" man  and why not, after seven marriages?? , had listed himself for mormon beard roles at the instigation of his fourth murder victim who had said:" with your beard, dear, you ought to be in movies"!! mills secured barco's photograph from the gentleman in charge, rushed to the hollywood police station to report the theft, and less than five minutes later, detectives with his picture in hand were on the trail of cal barco. on their way, they stopped at every gas station along the main boulevards to question the attendants. finally, at ye olde gasse filling station on avocado avenue, they learned that their man, having paused to get oil for his car, had asked about the route to san diego. they headed in that direction and, at san juan capistrano bythesea came upon barco sitting in the quaint old spanish mission drivein, eating a hot tamale. at the moment, barco's back was to the road so he did not see the detectives close in on his convertible which, in their quest for the stolen lap rug, they proceeded to search. the robe, however, was missing, for by that time barco had disposed of it at a pawnshop in glendale. the detectives placed barco under arrest and, without informing him of the nature of the charge, took him back to hollywood for questioning. thus it was that barco, apprehended for mere larceny, now began to suspect that one or another of his murders had been uncovered. during the return trip, barco kept muttering to himself in meaningless phrases, such as:" they are under sand dunes they are better off, i tell you i saved their souls". the detective, commenting on barco's behavior, felt that he merely belonged among the myriad citizens of our community who are mentally unhinged  that he was a more or less harmless" nut"!! however while in his cell awaiting trial for theft, barco, in a fit of apprehension, made an attempt to take his own life. the attempt had failed because, when endeavoring to cut his wrists, this murderer of seven women had fainted at the sight of blood. the jail authorities  attaching no particular significance to the episode  offered barco whisky to revive him;; but the old fellow, a lifelong teetotaler, refused it, and no more was thought of the matter. then it was that district attorney welch entered the case. a man of vaulting ambition, with one eye on the mayorship of los angeles, nothing ever escaped him which might possibly lead to personal publicity. it was reported to welch's office that a thief in the city jail had attempted suicide. welch wanted to know why. no one knew. now welch had a pet theory that everyone is guilty of breaking more laws than he ever gets caught at. the suicide attempt looked to him like an opportunity to put his theory to the test. so he paid a call on barco in his cell and began their chat by stating bluntly:" barco, we have got the goods on you!! it will be a lot better if you come clean". at first barco was evasive and shifty. but with welch's relentless pursuit of the subject, barco finally" broke" and started confessing to one murder after another. by the time barco reached the count of three, the situation seemed to welch almost too good to be true. but if true, it was the case of which he had dreamed, the case which would throw him into headlines all over america as the hero of a great murder trial. welch summoned jail officials to barco's cell. but to welch's chagrin, the police captain poohpoohed welch's credulity in barco's confession. barco was clearly a" nut". it required strength, bravado, daring to commit murder." that worm a murderer?? ridiculous"!! then, for the first time since his arrest, a glint of spirit lit barco's eyes. his manhood had been attacked. he stiffened and rose to his feet. he would show them!!" is that so"?? he queried." well, for ten years i have been murdering women. i can lead you to every one of the bodies, and there ai not four, nor five, nor six of'em  there is seven!!" the next day the police captain, in derision, organized what he termed" welch's wild goose chase". for indeed it seemed incredible that anyone could go on committing murder for ten years and not get caught at it, even in hollywood. the searching party consisted of the police captain, welch, barco, policemen with shovels, newspaper reporters, and cameramen. barco, his state of apprehension gone, never to return, had assumed a matteroffactness which remained his principal attitude from that time on. he directed the cortege of autos to the sand dunes near santa monica. stopping the cars at a fork in the road, he got out, paced off a certain distance to a spot between two shrubcovered sand hills, and indicated a location. orders were given to dig. nothing was found. welch was worried. the police captain chortled. the newspaper boys cracked jokes and again barco's pride was aroused. with greater precision he again paced off a location, this time a little more to the left. with quibs and gibes, the policemen again started digging. welch was on edge. the captain was remarking that it was a nice day for a picnic when finally one of the shovels struck an object." there is something here"!! said the digger. joking stopped and everyone gathered around. the digger, thrusting about with his shovel, now raised into view a package crudely wrapped in one of the murderer's hollywood sport shirts. although it was a mere fragment of the victim's remains, it was enough. welch was wild with delight. his elation grew as barco's seven disclosures brought to light one reward after another. now did welch truly become the man of the hour, and everything that followed in the procedure of justice was a new triumph for him. it went to his head, and his ambition increased. it was apparent that welch was in cahoots with marshall and would use his power as d.a. to drag every possible sensation into the case. every new scandal which would provide more" copy" for marshall's pen would thus mean more publicity for welch. i knew that both these cynics were waiting with impatience for the dramatic moment when viola was called to the stand. once there, the d.a. with devilish cleverness would provide marshall with headlines:" viola's multiple romances"" viola lake an addict"" downfall of another film idol"!! it would be fine publicity for the man who was willing to walk to the mayor's throne over the broken reputation of a helpless girl!! i studied welch closely as the trial progressed for any hint which might give me a lead as to how he might be thwarted. it was not long before i sensed that there was something deeper than overvaulting ambition back of his desire for viola's destruction. he was bitter and resentful toward her, personally resentful. a dreadful fear entered my consciousness that perhaps he had entertained aspirations toward viola's favors  or, even more serious perhaps, that he had attained a share of them and had then been superseded by some luckier chap. i did not rest until i had tracked the mystery down. well, here it is. one day over a year before, there had been a cocktail party in an apartment of a downtown hotel. viola had been urged to attend, by telephone, and not knowing the host or the character of the party, she had gone. she arrived late and as she entered the party, noted that gentlemen seemed to be in the majority;; the air was thick with smoke, empty bottles were in evidence, and several of the guests were somewhat the worse for liquor. naturally, viola had no wish to remain, but she felt she could not leave so soon after her arrival, in all politeness to her host. and it so happened that adjacent to a couch on which she had taken refuge was a small table on which she noted a vase of red rosebuds;; while projecting from beneath the couch were a pair of feet which, as fate would have it, belonged to district attorney welch. as viola sat there, a playful impulse overcame her to remove the shoes and socks from the unidentified feet and, as a prank, insert rosebuds between the toes. a little later the district attorney woke up, emerged from under the couch, looked at his watch, and realized he had an engagement that very hour to address a meeting of the culture forum on" the civic spirit of the southland", in the byzantine room of the hotel where his wife, as president of the forum, was to preside. he made his way to his host's bedroom where he carefully brushed himself off, neatly arranged his hair, and painstakingly selected his hat from the many on the bed. then, noting neither the absence of his footwear nor the presence of the rosebuds, he made his way to the byzantine room and, with his usual dignity, mounted the rostrum. the effect on the intellectuals among his audience may well be imagined. the incident, aside from reflecting on welch's political career, had all but wrecked his home life. he never rested until he discovered who the culprit was, and when he did, he vowed vengeance on viola lake if ever the chance came his way. and here it was!! by such innocent actions are human tragedies sometimes set in motion. during these first days of the trial i did not have as much time to commiserate with viola as i should have liked. in the first place, it was difficult for us to meet. we could not be seen together, for the tongue of scandal was ever ready to link our names, and the tongue of scandal finds but one thing to say of the association of a man with a girl, no matter how innocent. i could not invite viola to our house, for mother snobbishly refused to receive her. now the czarship had not affected my own sense of social values, but mother had attained a reflected glory through it, which had opened the doors of los angelespasadena society to her. there, mother was received by the scions of aristocratic lines which are dominated by the budweisers  of beer derivation , the chalmers  of underwear origin , and the heinzes  whose forbears founded a nationally famous trade in pickles . i hated being dragged into the salons of these aristocrats. but mother insisted, for it is seldom indeed that anyone remotely connected with the cinema is ever received in their exclusive midsts. in fact, it was not until the king of spain had visited at pickfair that mary and doug were beckoned to cross the sacred barriers which separate los angeles and pasadena from the hoipolloi. mother even went so far as to trump up for me matrimonial opportunities with pasadena debs who had been educated abroad, and with those of the more lenient los angeles area where a debutante was a girl who had been to high school. but at long last came a time when i broke away from mother and her society" chichi" in order to spend a cosy evening with viola and her chaperon at her home. however, such a hotbed of gossip had grown up during the trial, that every precaution had to be taken to keep my visit from being whispered to the world, society, and even, alas, to my own mother. when i arrived at viola's i was shown, to my surprise, into the kitchen. viola greeted me, in checked apron, ladle in hand, and explained it was the cook's night out and that she herself was preparing dinner. i sat and watched proceedings. there was to be roast chicken with dressing, giblet gravy, asparagus, new peas with a sprig of mint, creamed onions, and mashed potatoes  all chosen, prepared, and cooked by viola herself. ways of the sons of men: to give every one according to his

democratic government, it will be due in large part to the u.s. show of force that enabled president balaguer to prevent a threatened restoration of trujillo dictatorship. outwardly, ciudad trujillo is calm. none of the trujillo family remains. mr. balaguer is in control, and opposition leaders have no further excuse to suspect his offer of a coalition government preliminary to free elections in the spring. had u.s. warships not appeared off the dominican coast, there is every possibility that the country would now be wracked by civil war. ultimately either the trujillos would have been returned to power or the conflict would have produced conditions favorable to a takeover by dominican elements responsive to castro in cuba. within the organization of american states, there may be some criticism of this unilateral american intervention which was not without risk obviously. but there was no complaint from the dominican crowds which lined ciudad trujillo's waterfront shouting," vive yankees"!! more, the u.s. action was hailed by a principal opposition leader, dr. juan bosch, as having saved" many lives and many troubles in the near future". mr. balaguer's troubles are by no means over. he will need the help of all oas members to eradicate, finally, the forces of authoritarianism, protrujillo and procastro alike. in cooperating toward that objective, oas might move with the speed and effectiveness demonstrated by the united states. matter of survival those watching the growing rivalry between craft unions and industrial unions may recognize all the pressures that led to the big labor split in 1935. now, as then, it is a matter of jobs. craft unions seek work that industrial unions claim, such as factory maintenance. the issue was sufficiently potent in 1935 to spark secession from the american federation of labor of its industrial union members. that breach was healed 20 years later by merger of the american federation of labor and the congress of industrial organizations. or that is what it looked like at the time. but automation and the increasing complexity of factories has renewed the competition for jobs. walter reuther, leader of the industrial union faction of the aflcio, says another two years of this squabbling will be disastrous for all american labor. whether it could be as disastrous for american labor as, say, jimmy hoffa of the teamsters, is a matter of conjecture. but the jurisdictional disputes that result from the craftindustrial rivalry do not win friends for labor. engaged as it is in a battle for world trade as a condition of national survival, this country can have little patience with labor's family feuds. the concept of labor as a special class is outmoded, and in the task confronting america as bastion of the free world, labor must learn to put the national interest first if it is itself to survive. deterrent the army, navy and air force, among others, may question secretary freeman's claim that the high estate of united states agriculture is the" strongest deterrent" to the spread of communism. but the secretary insists that the success of the american farmer is the" greatest single source of strength" in the struggle to insure freedom around the world. mr. freeman said that in many of the countries he visited on a recent world trade trip people were more awed by america's capacity to produce food surpluses than by our industrial production  or even by the soviet's successes in space. this should not surprise the secretary;; american taxpayers have been impressed by the surpluses for a long, long time. in fact, over the years, the american farmer's capacity to overproduce has cost the taxpayers a large dollar. and thus far, mr. freeman has offered very little relief. the 1961 feed grain program, which the secretary sponsored, has been declared a billion dollar fiasco. in exchange for higher price supports, growers pledged reduction in planted acreage. but the farmers outsmarted washington by shortening the distance between the rows and pouring on the fertilizer. the result: 1.1 billion added to the deficit in the federal budget. perhaps, as mr. freeman says, american agriculture may stop the communists, but it is also swindling the american taxpayer. what is wrong at state a senate subcommittee headed by sen. jackson of washington has been going over the state department and has reached some predictable conclusions. the department needs a clearer" sense of direction" at the top and it needs fewer, but better, people, sen. jackson says. the subcommittee is not alone in questioning the effectiveness of the department. president kennedy has indicated his dissatisfaction with its performance. but those who would revitalize so complex an organization must, first of all, overcome the resistance of layers of officials wedded to traditional procedures, suspicious of innovation and fearful of mistakes. nor does sen. jackson discuss the delicate situation created by the presence in the white house of a corps of presidential assistants engaged in the study of foreign policy. this tends to create friction and confusion and has not made it easier for secretary rusk to restore vigor and initiative among his subordinates. but competent observers believe he is making progress, particularly toward what sen. jackson lists as the primary need " a clearer understanding of where our vital national interests lie and what we must do to promote them". the jackson report will provide some of the political support mr. rusk will need if he is to get rid of department personnel engaged, as sen. jackson puts it," in work that does not really need doing". mr. rusk should also draw comfort from sen. jackson's recommendation that congressional methods of dealing with national security problems be improved. selfcriticism is a rare but needed commodity in congress. betting men forecasting economic activity is a hazardous undertaking even for the specialist. but now apparently the job of secretary of labor requires that he be willing to risk his reputation as a prognosticator of unemployment trends. james p. mitchell, when he was the head of the department, promised to eat his hat if unemployment did not drop below three million a couple of years ago. he lost, but settled for a cake in the shape of a fedora. his successor, secretary goldberg, also has been guessing wrong on a drop in the unemployment rate which has been holding just under 7 per cent for the last 11 months. no betting man, mr. goldberg says he is merely" putting my neck out again" by predicting the rate will go down this month. he is basing his guess on new government statistics that show business has broadened its stride  a new record high in personal income, an increase in housing starts, a spurt in retail sales and a gain in orders for durable goods. mr. mitchell had an excuse for losing  the steel strike lasted much longer than he anticipated. mr. goldberg has less reason for missing. the economy seems to be sailing along on an even keel and the 1961 hurricane season and auto strikes are at an end so they cannot be blamed in november. the odds thus appear favorable that the secretary's neck may be spared. little resistance cambodia's chief of state, who has been accused of harboring communist marauders and otherwise making life miserable for neighboring south viet nam and thailand, insists he would be very unhappy if communism established its power in southeast asia. but so convinced of communism's inevitable triumph is prince sihanouk that he is ready to throw in the towel." i have to see the facts", is the way the prince puts it. and from that point of vantage he concedes another two years of grace to nations maintaining a prowestern posture. prince sihanouk's powers of prognostication some day may be confirmed but history is not likely to praise the courage of his convictions. bottom sighted commerce secretary hodges seems to have been cast in the role of pacemaker for official washington's economic forecasters. weeks ago he saw a business upturn in the second quarter of this year while his colleagues in the cabinet were shaking their heads in disagreement. recently treasury secretary dillon and labor secretary goldberg fell into line with mr. hodges" appraisal, though there has been some reluctance to do so at the white house. and now mr. hodges has pioneered further into the economic unknown with the announcement that he thinks business has stopped sliding and that it should start going upward from this point. he is the first top administration officer to see the bottom of the slump. the secretary based his assessment on the upturn in retail sales. february's volume was 1 per cent above january's for the first pickup since last october, although it is still 1.5 per cent off from february 1960. corroborating mr. hodges" figures was the federal reserve board's report of the large sales increase in the nation's department stores for the week ending march 4. in newark, for example, this gain was put at 26 per cent above the yearearlier level. of course, some of the credit for the sale boost must be given to improvement in the weather and to the fact that easter comes more than two weeks earlier than in 1960. another optimistic sign, this one from the labor department, was the report that the long rise in unemployment compensation payments" was interrupted for the first time in the week ending feb. 25". initial claims for jobless benefits were said to have dropped by 8,100 in the week ending march 4. mr. hodges is so hopeful over the outlook that he does not think there will be any need of a cut in income taxes. well, we cannot have everything. prosperity for the whole nation is certainly preferred to a tax cut. in new jersey, too new jersey folk need not be told of the builder's march to the sea, for in a single generation he has parceled and populated miles of our shoreline and presses on to develop the few open spaces that remain. now the stone harbor bird sanctuary, 31 acres of magic attraction for exotic herons, is threatened, but the battlefront extends far beyond our state. against the dramatic fight being waged for preservation of 30 miles of cape cod shoreline, the tiny tract at stone harbor may seem unimportant. but interior secretary udall warns that there is a race on between those who would develop our few surviving open shorelines and those who would save them for the enjoyment of all as public preserves. the move for establishment of a national seashore park on 30,000 acres of cape cod, from provincetown to chatham, is strengthened by president kennedy's interest in that area. but preservation of the natural beauty of the cape is of more than regional concern, for the automobile age has made it the recreation spot of people from all over the country. by comparison, stone harbor bird sanctuary's allies seem less formidable, for aside from the audubon society, they are mostly the snowy, common and cattle egrets and the louisiana, green, little blue and blackcrowned herons who nest and feed there. but there is hope, for conservation commissioner bontempo has tagged the sanctuary as the kind of place the state hopes to include in its program to double its park space. the desirability of

mass, and at noon, and at six each evening  its tone, repetitive, monotonous, never breaking the boredom of the streets. the old man was unimportant. yet if he were not there, they would have missed him, as they would have missed the sounds of bees buzzing against the screen door in early june;; or the smell of thick tomato paste  the ripe smell that was both sweet and sour  rising up from aluminum trays wrapped in flydotted cheesecloth. or the surging whirling sounds of bats at night, when their black bodies dived into the blackness above and below the amber street lights. or the bay of female dogs in heat. they never called him by name, although he had one. filippo rossi, that is what he was called in the old country;; but here he was just signore or the old man. but this was not unusual, because youth in these quarters was always pushed at a distance from its elders. youth obeyed when commanded. it went to church on sunday and one saturday a month went to confession. but youth asked nothing of its parents  not a touch of the hand or a kiss given in passing. the only thing unusual about the old man had long since happened. but the past was dead here as the present was dead. once the old man had had a wife. and once she, too, ignored him. with a tiny furpiece wrapped around her shoulders, she wiggled her satincovered buttocks down the street before him and did not stop. in one hand she clutched a hundred dollar bill and in the other a straw suitcase. the way she strutted down the street, the old man would have been blind not to have noticed both. without looking at him, without looking at anything except drexel street directly in front of her, she climbed up into one of those orange streetcars, rode away in it, and never came back." but she should not have come here in the first place", the women had said." no, no. not that one. she thought she was bigger than we are because she came from torino"." eh, torino!! she gave herself fancy airs!! just because she had a part on the stage in the old country, she thought she could carry her head higher than ours". they had slapped their thighs." it is not for making pretty speeches about dante those actresses get paid so good"." henh"!! calloused fingers, caressed only by the smoothness of polished rosaries, had swayed excitedly beneath puckered chins where tiny black hairs sprouted, never to be tweezed away. mauvecolored mouths that had never known anything sweeter than the taste of new wine and the passion of man's tongue had not smiled, but had condemned again and again." puttana"!! but if the old man even thought about his wife now, nobody cared a fig. it was enough for people to know that at one time he had looked down the street at the fleshy suppleness of a woman he had consumed  watching her become thinner and thinner in the distance, as thin as the seams on her stockings, and still thinner. his voice had not commanded her to stop. it had not questioned why. the women said they had seen him wave an exhausted farewell;; but he might have been shooing away the fleas that hopped from his yellow dog onto him.  he was never without that dog.  and his eyes  those miniature sundials of variegated yellow  had not altered their expression or direction. the old man's very soul could have left him and flown down that street, but he would not have had anyone know it. perhaps he had known then where that hundred dollar bill had come from and where it was taking his wife. but when he called for his withered, wrinkled sister rose to care for him and the children, had he guessed that all he would remember of his woman was the memory of her climbing into that streetcar?? there seemed to be a contemptuous purpose in the way he sat there with his eyes glued to drexel street and his back in opposition to the church behind him. for all he saw or cared to see, this could have been a town in italy, not the outskirts of philadelphia. it could have been bari or chieti for the way it smelled. what did it matter to him that the park at the foot of ash road stretched beneath elevated trains that roared from the stucco station into the city's center at halfhour intervals?? or that the tiny creek spun its silent course toward the schuylkill?? this place was hatred to him, just as hatred was his only companion in his aloneness. to him they were one and the same. sameness for the old man was framed in by a wall of ginkgo trees which divided these quarters from the city. sameness lined the streets with twostory houses the color of ash. it slashed the sloping manurescented lawns with concrete steps which climbed upward to white wooden porches. it swayed with the wicker swings and screeched with the rusted hinges of screen doors. even the stablegarage, which housed nothing now but the scent of rot, had a lawn before it. and the coffee shop on drexel street, where the men spent their evenings and sundays playing cards, had a rose hedge beneath its window. the hedge reeked of coffee dregs thrown against it. only one house on the street had no lawn before it. it squatted low and square upon the sidewalk with a heavy iron grating supporting a glass facade. that was bartoli's shop. above it, from a secondstory showroom, wooden angels surveyed the neighborhood. did the old man remember them there?? yet everywhere else sameness was stucco and wood in square blocks  like fortresses perched against the slant of the hill, rising with the hill to the top where the church was and beyond that to the cemetery. only paved alleyways tunneled through the walls of those fortresses into the mysterious core of intimacy behind the houses where backyards owned no fences, where one man's property blended with the next to form courtyards in which no one knew privacy. love and hatred and fear were one here, shaded only by fig trees and grape vines. and the forked tongue of gossip licked its sinister way from back porch to back porch. the old man silently fed upon these streets. they kept him alive, waiting. waiting for what and for whom, only he could tell and would not. it was as though he had made a pact with the devil himself, but it was not yet time to pay the price. he was holding out for something. he was determined to hold out. the old man's son threw himself down, belly first, upon a concrete step, taking in the coolness of it, and dreaming of the day he would be rich. at fifteen he did not care that he had no mother, that he could not remember her face or her touch;; neither did he care that aunt rose provided for him. he was named pompeii as a tribute to his heritage, and he could not have cared less about that either. to him life was a restless boredom that began with the rising sun and ended only with sleep. when he would be a man, he would be a rich man. he would not be like the" rich americans" who lived in whitecolumned houses on the other side of the park. he would not ride the eightthirty local to the city each morning. he would not carry a brief case. nor would he work at all. he would square his shoulders and carry a cane before each step. he would sit inside the coffee shop and pound a gloved fist upon the table and a girl would hear him and come running, bowing with her running, calling out in her bowing," at your service". he would order her to bring coffee, and would take from his vest pocket a thin black pipe which he would stuff  he would not remove his gloves  and light and smoke. he could do that when he would be a man." hey, laura"!! he called to his sister on the porch above the steps. she was only ten months older than he." laura, what would you say if i smoked a pipe"?? laura did not answer him. she leaned unconcerned against the broken porch fence, brushing and drying her wet, gilded hair in the sun. one lithe leg straddled the railing and swung loosely before the creaking, torn pales. her tanned foot, whose arch swept high and white, pointed artfully toward tapering toes  toes like fingers, whose tips glowed white. all the while she sat there, her sinewy arms swirled before her chest. her face showed no sign of having heard pompeii. it was a face that had lost its childlike softness and was beginning to fold within its fragile features a harshness that belied the lyric lines of its contours. the eyes, blue and always somewhat downcast, possessed a sullen quality. even though the boy could not see them, he knew they were clouded by distance. he was never sure they fully took him in. pompeii called again," laura"!! but the only answer that reached him was the screeching of the porch rail from her leg moving against it." she is in a mood", he thought" there is not a month she does not get herself in a mood". well, what did that matter when the sun was shining and there were dreams to dream about?? and as for his pipe, if he wanted to smoke one, nobody would stop him. not even laura. suddenly he was interrupted in his daydreaming by a warm wetness lapping against his chin, and his eyes opened wide and long at the sight of a goat's claret tongue, feasting against the salt taste of him. above the tongue, an aged yellow eye, sallow and timecast, encrusted within a sphere of marbleized pink skin, stared unfalteringly at him." christ sake, goat, git"!! but the goat would not." you are boiling milk, ai not you"?? soothing it with his hand, knowing the whiskered jowls and the swollen smoothness of teats that wrinkled expectantly to his touch. pompeii rolled over. his head undulated gradually, covering space, to come straining beneath the taut belly within the warmth of those teats. with his mouth opened wide, he squirted the warm white milk against the roof of his mouth and his tongue savored the light, earthy taste of it. the boy's fingers and mouth operated with the skilled unity of a bagpipe player, pressing and pulling, delighting in what he did. above him slid the evasive shadow of a storm cloud. its form was a heavy figure in a fluttering soutane. but the boy could see only the goat's belly. the old man near the corner let the shadow pass over him, sensing something portentous in it. he knew it was there, knew also what it was about, but he would not raise a finger except to smooth his yellow dog's back. there would be time enough, perhaps the old man reassured himself, to pay the devil his due. time enough to give up his soul. in the meantime, six sandals, stained an ocher, the same color as pompeii's shaved hair, edged up close to him. the clapping they made on the concrete interrupted him in the ecstatic pleasure he knew, so that he quickly released his hold on the goat and pretended to be examining its haunches for ticks. he knew at a glance that the biggest sandals belonged to niobe, the neatest ones to concetta, and the laced ones to romeo, concetta's idiot brother. pompeii expected romeo's small body to sink closer and closer to the ground. he expected concetta's thin hand to reach down to grasp the boy, and her shrill, impetuous voice to sound against the rotundity of his disfigured flesh that was never sure of hearing anything. first, as i am his kinsman, and his subiect, 5:17 and the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and of children of judah were oppressed together: and all that took them inside

years for girls. in contrast, 20 of the 21 lines in the completion profile  excluding center 5 for boys and 4 for girls  are bunched and extend over a much shorter period, approximately 30 months for boys and 40 months for girls. the maturity chart for each sex demonstrates clearly that onset is a phenomenon of infancy and early childhood whereas completion is a phenomenon of the later portion of adolescence. second, for both sexes, the 21 transverse lines in the onset profile vary more in individual spread than those in the completion profile. although the standard deviation values on which spread of the lines is based are relatively larger for those centers which begin to ossify early  table 1 , there are considerable differences in this value between centers having the closely timed onsets. third, the process of calcification is seen to begin later and to continue much longer for these boys than for the girls, a fact which confirms data for other groups of children. the onset profile and completion profile are constructed to serve as norms for children. it is convenient to classify a child's onset ages and completion ages as" advanced"," moderate"  modal , or" delayed" according to whether the child's age equivalent" dots" appeared to the left of, upon, or to the right of the appropriate short transverse line. when a dot appears close to the end of the transverse line, the" moderate" rating may be further classified according to the position of the dot with respect to the vertical marking denoting the mean age. such classifications may be called" somewhat advanced" or" somewhat delayed", as the case may be, reserving" moderate" for dots upon or close to the mean. in the lower portion of each chart, the skeletal age  hand  of boy 34 and girl 2 may be similarly classified. there the middle one of the three curves denotes" mean skeletal age" for the maturity series boys and girls. the upper curve denotes the mean plus one standard deviation, and the lower curve represents the mean minus one standard deviation. thus, a child's skeletal age" dots" may be classified as" advanced" when they appear above the middle curve," moderate" when they appear immediately above or below the middle curve, and" delayed" when they appear below the lower curve. to summarize the purpose of the skeletal maturity chart: each contains two kinds of skeletal maturity norms which show two quite different methods of depicting developmental level of growth centers. first, the upper portion requires series of films for every child, consisting of those from hand, elbow, shoulder, knee, and foot. the lower portion necessitates only films of hand. second, the upper portion permits comparison of maturity levels of an equal number of growth centers from the long, short, and round bones of the five regions. the lower portion permits comparison of maturity levels of short and round bones predominantly, since only two long bones are included in hand and wrist as a region. third, the upper portion deals with only two indicators of developmental level, onset and completion. the lower portion utilizes the full complement of intermediate maturity indicators of each hand center as well as their onset and completion. fourth, the two indicators are for the most part widely separated chronologically, with the extensive age gap occurring during childhood for all but one growth center. the lower portion provides a rating at any stage between infancy and adulthood. onsets, completions, and skeletal ages  hand  of boy 34 and girl 2 may be directly compared and classified, using only those skeletal ages which appear immediately below the onset profile and the completion profile. it may be assumed that differences in ratings due to selection of growth centers from specific regions of the body will be small, according to existing tables of onset age and completion age for centers throughout the body. accordingly, maturity level ratings by means of the upper portion and lower portion of the chart, respectively, should be somewhat similar since skeletal age assessments are dependent upon onsets during infancy and upon completions during adolescence. it is clear that there are some differences in the ratings, but there is substantial agreement. since a skeletal age rating can be made at any age during growth, from elbow, shoulder, knee, or foot as well as hand, it seems to be the method of choice when one wishes to study most aspects of skeletal developmental progress during childhood. as stated earlier in the paper, onsets and completions  particularly the former  provide a different tool or indicator of expectancy in osseous development, each within a limited age period. such an indicator, or indicators, are needed as means of recognizing specific periods of delay in skeletal developmental progress. it was stated earlier that one purpose of this study was to extend the analysis of variability of onset and completion in each of the 21 growth centers somewhat beyond that provided by the data in tables 1 and 2. as one approach to doing this, figures 3 and 4 have be constructed from the mean ages and the individual onset and completion ages for boy 34 and girl 2. the differences between onset age and completion age with respect to the corresponding mean age have been brought into juxtaposition by means of a series of arrows. the data for boy 34 appear in figure 3, and for girl 2 in figure 4. the numbering system used in tables 1 and 2 and figures 1 and 2 was continued for the 21 growth centers. the" dot" on one end of each arrow indicates extent of difference in months between the child's onset age and the corresponding mean age for the growth center. the" tip" of the arrow represents extent of difference between the child's completion age and the corresponding mean age for the growth center. thus, the alignment of the" dots" and" tips", respectively, indicate individual variability of the 21 growth centers of each child with respect to the mean values for these boys and girls. the direction in which the arrow points shows how the maturity level of the growth center was changed at completion from the level at onset. when the" dot" and" tip" coincide, the classification used in this paper is" same schedule". the length of the arrow indicates amount of slowing or acceleration at completion over that at onset, and the difference in months can be read roughly by referring the arrow to the age scale along the base of each figure, or more precisely by referring to the original data in the appropriate tables. the difference between the sequence of onset of ossification for the sexes governs the numbering sequence in figures 3 and 4. this difference is readily clarified by referring to table 1. for example, arrow 17 in figure 3 portrays the proximal radial epiphysis for boy 34, whereas the same epiphysis for girl 2 is portrayed by arrow 18 in figure 4. for the boy, this epiphysis was markedly delayed at onset but near the mean at completion. thus, the span of its ossification was shortened and the center's ability to" catch up" in ossification is demonstrated. in contrast, for the girl the epiphysis was slightly advanced at onset and delayed at completion. obviously, the slowing for her may have occurred at any point between onset and completion. the skeletal age curve in the lower portion of figure 2 shows that slowing may have occurred for her during the prepubescent period. length of the shaft of these arrows may be evaluated according to the standard deviation values for each center in table 1. we have attempted to simplify the extensive task of analyzing onset ages and completion ages of each child  more than 1700 values for the entire group  by constructing figures for each of the 21 centers so that the data for all 34 boys and 34 of the girls will appear together for each growth center. figures 5 and 6 are examples of our method of analyzing the results for each growth center. forty other figures similar to 5 and 6 and the original data used in the construction of all figures and tables in this monograph have been included in the appendix. the principles used in making each arrow for figures 3 and 4 were applied to the construction of figures 5 and 6 as well as all figures in the appendix. one growth center in a short bone  distal phalanx of the second finger  was chosen as an example for discussion here, primarily because epiphysealdiaphyseal fusion, the maturity indicator for completion in long and short bones, occurs in this center for girls near the menarche and for boys near their comparable pubescent stage. its completion thus becomes one of the convenient maturity indicators to include in studies of growth, dietary patterns, and health during adolescence. the following summary, based on figures 5 and 6, is an example of one way of interpreting the 42 figures constructed from onset ages and completion ages of individual children with respect to the appropriate mean age for each growth center. at the top of figure 5, for example, the onset range and completion range lines for the chosen growth center have been drawn for girls according to their mean and standard deviation values in table 1. the 34 arrows, denoting onset age plus completion age deviations, have been arrayed in an onset sequence which begins with girl 18 who had the earliest onset of the 34 girls. the growth center depicted here, in the distal phalanx of the second finger, is listed as the fifth of those in the seven short bones. the mean onset age was 25.3 months  table 1 , and the average span of the osseous stage was 133 months. the correlation  table 2  between onset age and completion age was .50, and that between onset age and span was .10. with due consideration for the limits of precision in assessing, expected rate of change in ossification of girls age 2 years, and the known variations in rate of ossification of these children as described in our preceding paper in the supplement, each arrow with a" shaft length" of four months or less was selected as indicating" same schedule" at onset and completion, for this particular epiphysis. accordingly, girls 31, 29, 33, 21, 26, 13, 3, 4, 14, 32, 24, 25, 34, 23, 6, 15, 22, and 16 may be said to have the" same schedule" at onset and completion. it seems clear, from the counterbalanced shape of the series of arrows in figure 5 that there was about an equal number of early and late onsets and completions for the 34 girls. accordingly, if epiphysealdiaphyseal fusion occurs in this phalanx near menarche, early and late menarches might have been forecast rather precisely at the time of onset of ossification for the 18 girls with" same schedule". as an example of the interpretation of an arrow in the figure which exceeds four months in shaft length in conjunction with its position in the figure: girl 2 had a delayed onset and further delayed completion. it is of interest that her menarche was somewhat later than the average for the girls in this group. a similar analysis of figure 6 for the 34 boys would necessitate quite a different conclusion about the predictive value of onset age in forecasting their attainment of the pubescent stage. boys 32, 23, 31, 17, 30, 19, and 24 had" same schedule" at onset and completion;; thus early forecasting of the pubescent stage would appear possible for only seven boys. boy 34, like girl 2, did not have" same schedule";; his arrow crosses the line denoting the mean. the" dot" on his arrow indicates early onset and the" tip" indicates relatively later completion. after the 42 figures had been drawn like figures 5 and 6, classifications of the onset ages and completion ages were summarized from them. enter macbeth, banquo, rosse, and angus. know, are to meet at the ostrich at twelve, and the race to begin at one, pitch, i could not get near you. i do not know what has

one favor, dad. just do not tell ferguson that crazy opinion of yours"." why not"?? the old man gave the room a stare in leaving;; under the scraggly brows the pale old eyes burned with a bitter memory." it is the truth"." the bartlett girl was killed by mr. dronk's son. rossi and ferguson have been across the street, talking to the kid. they have found some sort of new evidence, a bundle of clothes or something, and it must link the kid even stronger to the crime. why will not you accept facts?? the two kids were together a lot, they were having some kind of teenage affair  god knows how far that had gone  and the kid's crippled. he limps, and the man who hit you and took the cane, he limped. my god, how much more do you want"?? his father looked him over closely." you sound like an old woman. you should have gone to work today,"stead of sneaking around spying on the dronk house"." now, see here" " the trouble with you", old man arthur began, and then checked himself. young mrs. arthur had opened the oven and there was a drifting odor of hot biscuits. the old man opened the door and stepped out into the sunlight." is not enough time to go into it", he finished, and slammed the door in his son's face. mrs. holden turned from the window draperies." they found something else up there", she said halfaloud to the empty room." they took it away, overalls or something". she walked restlessly across the room, then back to the windows." now they have gone, they did not come back, and they did not arrest that dronk boy". she stood frowning and chewing her lip. she was wearing a brown cotton dress, cut across the hips in a way that was supposed to make her look slimmer, a yoke set into the skirt and flaring pleats below. she smoothed the skirt, sat down, then stood up and went back to the windows." why on earth did i send him off to work?? there was excuse enough to keep him home that young mr. arthur's still over there". with sudden energy, she went to the phone and rang holden's office and asked for him." i think you had better come home"." mae, we are so busy. mr. crosson's been on everybody's neck, an order he expected did not come through and he is" " i do not care. i want you here. i am all alone and certain things are going on that look very ominous. i need someone to go out and find out what is happening"." but i could not do that, even if i were home"!! his voice grew high and trembling." i cannot be underfoot every time those cops turn around!! they will they will think i did something". he could not see the grin that split her mouth;; the teeth that shone into the phone were like a shark's." you will just have to risk it. you cannot wander along in the dark, can you?? i would think that you even more than i would be wondering what they are up to. they found some clothes", she tossed in." what"?? deliberately, she ignored the yelp." also, that mr. ferguson was here. i guess he wants to ask you some questions. i stalled him off. he does not expect you until five"." then i would better wait until five"." nooo. come home right away". she slapped the receiver into its holder and stepped away. her eyes were bright with anticipation. in his office, mr. holden replaced the phone slowly. he rose from his chair. he had to cough then;; he went to the window and choked there with the fresh breeze on his face. he got his hat out of the closet. for a moment he thought of going into crosson's office to explain that he had to leave, but there was now such a pain in his chest, such a pounding in his head, that he decided to let it go. he passed the receptionist in the outer office, muttering," i have got to go out for a little while". let her call crosson if she wanted to, let crosson raise the roof or even can him, he did not care. he got into the car. putting the key into the switch, pressing the accelerator with his foot, putting the car into reverse, seemed vast endeavors almost beyond the ability of his shaking body. once out in the street, the traffic was a gadfly maze in which he wandered stricken. when he turned into the highway that led to the outskirts of the city and then rose toward home, he had to pull over to the curb and wait for a few minutes, sucking in air and squinting and blinking his eyes to clear them of tears. what on earth was in mae's mind, that she wanted him up there spying on what the cops were doing?? what did she think he could do?? he tried to ignore what his own common sense told him, but it was not possible;; her motives were too blatant. she wanted him to get into trouble. she wanted the police to notice him, suspect him. she was going to keep on scheming, poking, prodding, suggesting, and dictating until the cops got up enough interest in him to go back to their old neighborhood and ask questions. and he knew in that moment, with a cold sinking of despair, a dying of old hopes, that mae had spread some kind of word there among the neighbors. nothing bald, open;; but enough. they would have some suspicions to repeat to the police. though his inner thoughts cringed at it, he forced himself to think back, recreating the scene in which mae claimed to have caught him molesting the child. it had not amounted to anything. there had been nothing evil or dirty in his intentions. a second scene flashed before his mind, the interior of the garage at the new house and the young bartlett girl turning startled to meet him, the dim dark and the sudden confusion and fear and then the brightness as mae had clicked on the light. suppose the cops somehow got hold of that?? well, it had not been what it seemed, he would had no idea the girl was in there. he had not touched her. and when he came to examine the scene, there was a certain staginess to it, it had the smell of planning, and a swift suspicion darted into his mind. too monstrous, of course. mae would not have plotted a thing like that. it was just that little accidents played into her hands. like this murder. he leaned on the wheel, clutching it, staring into the sunlight, and tried to bring order into his thoughts. he felt lightheaded and sick. there was no use wandering off into a territory of utter nightmare. mae was his wife. she was married to him for better or for worse. she would not be wilfully planning his destruction. but she was. she was. even as the conviction of truth roared through him, shattering his last hope of safety, he was reaching to release the hand brake, to head up the road for home, doing her bidding. he drove, and the road wobbled, familiar scenes crept past on either side. he came to a stretch of old orange groves, the trees dead, some of them uprooted, and then there was an outlying shopping area, and tract houses. he had the feeling that he should abandon the car and run off somewhere to hide. but he could not imagine where. there was really no place to go, finally, except home to mae. at the gate he slowed, looking around. cooper was beside his car, on the curb at the right, just standing there morosely;; he did not even look up. behind him on the steps of the little office sat old man arthur;; he was straight, something angry in his attitude, as if he might be waiting to report something. holden stepped on the gas. a new idea drifted in from nowhere. he could go to the police. he could tell them his fears of being involved, he could explain what had happened in the old neighborhood and how mae had misunderstood and how she had held it over him  the scene was complete in his mind at the moment, even to his own jerkings and snivelings, and ferguson's silent patience. he could throw himself on the mercy of the police department. it was not what mae would want him to do, though. he was sure of this. once he had abandoned himself to the very worst, once he had quieted all the dragons of worry and suspense, there would not be very much for mae to do. at that moment, holden almost slammed on the brakes to go back to cooper and ask if ferguson was about. it would be such a relief. what was that old sign, supposed to be painted over a door somewhere, abandon hope, all ye who enter here?? why, holden said to himself, surprised at his own sudden insight, i will bet some of those people who enter are just as happy as can be. they have worried, they have lain awake nights, they have shook at the slightest footstep, they have pictured their own destruction, and now it is all over and they can give up. sure, they are giving up hope. hand in hand with hope went things like terror and apprehension. goodbye. holden waved a hand at the empty street. glad to see you go. he drove into the paved space before the garage and got out, slamming the car door. he looked up and down the street. if ferguson's car had been in sight, holden would have walked directly to it. he went to the front door and opened it and looked in. mae entered the room from the hallway to the kitchen. she had a cup of something steaming, coffee perhaps, in one hand, a fresh piece of toast in the other. she stood there, watching holden come in, and she put the piece of toast in her mouth and bit off one corner with a huge chomp of her white teeth." mae" " i have been thinking", she said, swallowing the toast." did not you have an old pair of painting overalls in the garage?? you used them that time you painted the porch at our other house. and then you wiped up some grease". she had caught him off guard, no preparation, nothing certain but that ahead lay some kind of disaster." no. wait a minute. what do you" " i have been looking for them, and they are gone. i am sure they were in the garage up until a couple of days ago. or even yesterday. you used to paint in them, and then you just took them for rags. the police have them now"." i do not remember any overalls at all"." they were all faded. worn through at the knees". she stood sipping and chewing and watching." green paint, was not it?? well, i am not sure of the color. but you had them"." mae, sit down. put down the cup of coffee. tell me what this is all about". she shook her head. she took another bite of toast. holden noticed almost absently how she chewed, how the whole side of her cheek moved, a slab of fat that extended down into her neck." my goodness, you ought to remember if i do. you are going to have to go to the police and explain what happened. tell them the truth or something before they come here". a seeping coldness entered holden's being;; his nerves seemed frostbitten down to the tips of his tingling fingers and his spine felt stiff and glasslike, liable to break like an icicle at any moment." i have never owned any painting overalls. of their meals, she had never been obliged to go without sensitive conscience, would have felt all that the obtained for her by the honesty of her adopted children." back to you this minute," said susan. choked it. 18:17 and was drawn from the

he arrived before the hour. his letter had suggested we meet at my hotel at noon on sunday, and i came into the lobby as the clock struck twelve. he was waiting. my wish to meet samuel beckett had been prompted by simple curiosity and interest in his work. american newspaper reviewers like to call his plays nihilistic. they find deep pessimism in them. even so astute a commentator as harold clurman of the nation has said that" waiting for godot" is" the concentrate of the contemporary european mood of despair". but to me beckett's writing had seemed permeated with love for human beings and with a kind of humor that i could reconcile neither with despair nor with nihilism. could it be that my own eyes and ears had deceived me?? is his a literature of defeat, irrelevant to the social crises we face?? or is it relevant because it teaches us something useful to know about ourselves?? i knew that a conversation with the author would not settle such questions, because a man is not the same as his writing: in the last analysis, the questions had to be settled by the work itself. nevertheless i was curious. my curiosity was sharpened a day or two before the interview by a conversation i had with a wellinformed teacher of literature, a jesuit father, at a conference on religious drama near paris. when beckett's name came into the discussion, the priest grew loud and told me that beckett" hates life". that, i thought, is at least one thing i can find out when we meet. beckett's appearance is roughhewn irish. the features of his face are distinct, but not fine. they look as if they had been sculptured with an unsharpened chisel. unruly hair goes straight up from his forehead, standing so high that the top falls gently over, as if to show that it really is hair and not bristle. one might say it combines the man;; own pride and humility. for he has the pride that comes of selfacceptance and the humility, perhaps of the same genesis, not to impose himself upon another. his light blue eyes, set deep within the face, are actively and continually looking. he seems, by some unconscious division of labor, to have given them that one function and no other, leaving communication to the rest of the face. the mouth frequently breaks into a disarming smile. the voice is light in timbre, with a rough edge that corresponds to his visage. the irish accent is, as one would expect, combined with slight inflections from the french. his tweed suit was a baggy gray and green. he wore a brown knit sports shirt with no tie. we walked down the rue de l'arcade, thence along beside the madeleine and across to a sidewalk cafe opposite that church. the conversation that ensued may have been engrossing but it could hardly be called worldshattering. for one thing, the world that beckett sees is already shattered. his talk turns to what he calls" the mess", or sometimes" this buzzing confusion". i reconstruct his sentences from notes made immediately after our conversation. what appears here is shorter than what he actually said but very close to his own words." the confusion is not my invention. we cannot listen to a conversation for five minutes without being acutely aware of the confusion. it is all around us and our only chance now is to let it in. the only chance of renovation is to open our eyes and see the mess. it is not a mess you can make sense of". i suggested that one must let it in because it is the truth, but beckett did not take to the word truth." what is more true than anything else?? to swim is true, and to sink is true. one is not more true than the other. one cannot speak anymore of being, one must speak only of the mess. when heidegger and sartre speak of a contrast between being and existence, they may be right, i do not know, but their language is too philosophical for me. i am not a philosopher. one can only speak of what is in front of him, and that now is simply the mess". then he began to speak about the tension in art between the mess and form. until recently, art has withstood the pressure of chaotic things. it has held them at bay. it realized that to admit them was to jeopardize form." how could the mess be admitted, because it appears to be the very opposite of form and therefore destructive of the very thing that art holds itself to be"?? but now we can keep it out no longer, because we have come into a time when" it invades our experience at every moment. it is there and it must be allowed in". i granted this might be so, but found the result to be even more attention to form than was the case previously. and why not?? how, i asked, could chaos be admitted to chaos?? would not that be the end of thinking and the end of art?? if we look at recent art we find it preoccupied with form. beckett's own work is an example. plays more highly formalized than" waiting for godot"," endgame", and" krapp's last tape" would be hard to find." what i am saying does not mean that there will henceforth be no form in art. it only means that there will be new form, and that this form will be of such a type that it admits the chaos and does not try to say that the chaos is really something else. the form and the chaos remain separate. the latter is not reduced to the former. that is why the form itself becomes a preoccupation, because it exists as a problem separate from the material it accommodates. to find a form that accommodates the mess, that is the task of the artist now". yet, i responded, could not similar things be said about the art of the past?? is it not characteristic of the greatest art that it confronts us with something we cannot clarify, demanding that the viewer respond to it in his own neverpredictable way?? what is the history of criticism but the history of men attempting to make sense of the manifold elements in art that will not allow themselves to be reduced to a single philosophy or a single aesthetic theory?? is not all art ambiguous??" not this", he said, and gestured toward the madeleine. the classical lines of the church which napoleon thought of as a temple of glory, dominated all the scene where we sat. the boulevard de la madeleine, the boulevard malesherbes, and the rue royale ran to it with graceful flattery, bearing tidings of the age of reason." not this. this is clear. this does not allow the mystery to invade us. with classical art, all is settled. but it is different at chartres. there is the unexplainable, and there art raises questions that it does not attempt to answer". i asked about the battle between life and death in his plays. didi and gogo hover on the edge of suicide;; hamm's world is death and clov may or may not get out of it to join the living child outside. is this lifedeath question a part of the chaos??" yes. if life and death did not both present themselves to us, there would be no inscrutability. if there were only darkness, all would be clear. it is because there is not only darkness but also light that our situation becomes inexplicable. take augustine's doctrine of grace given and grace withheld: have you pondered the dramatic qualities in this theology?? two thieves are crucified with christ, one saved and the other damned. how can we make sense of this division?? in classical drama, such problems do not arise. the destiny of racine's phedre is sealed from the beginning: she will proceed into the dark. as she goes, she herself will be illuminated. at the beginning of the play she has partial illumination and at the end she has complete illumination, but there has been no question but that she moves toward the dark. that is the play. within this notion clarity is possible, but for us who are neither greek nor jansenist there is not such clarity. the question would also be removed if we believed in the contrary  total salvation. but where we have both dark and light we have also the inexplicable. the key word in my plays is" perhaps". given a theological lead, i asked what he thinks about those who find a religious significance to his plays." well, really there is none at all. i have no religious feeling. once i had a religious emotion. it was at my first communion. no more. my mother was deeply religious. so was my brother. he knelt down at his bed as long as he could kneel. my father had none. the family was protestant, but for me it was only irksome and i let it go. my brother and mother got no value from their religion when they died. at the moment of crisis it had no more depth than an old school tie. irish catholicism is not attractive, but it is deeper. when you pass a church on an irish bus, all the hands flurry in the sign of the cross. one day the dogs of ireland will do that too and perhaps also the pigs". but do the plays deal with the same facets of experience religion must also deal with??" yes, for they deal with distress. some people object to this in my writing. at a party an english intellectual  socalled  asked me why i write always about distress. as if it were perverse to do so!! he wanted to know if my father had beaten me or my mother had run away from home to give me an unhappy childhood. i told him no, that i had had a very happy childhood. then he thought me more perverse than ever. i left the party as soon as possible and got into a taxi. on the glass partition between me and the driver were three signs: one asked for help for the blind, another help for orphans, and the third for relief for the war refugees. one does not have to look for distress. it is screaming at you even in the taxis of london". lunch was over, and we walked back to the hotel with the light and dark of paris screaming at us. the personal quality of samuel beckett is similar to qualities i had found in the plays. he says nothing that compresses experience within a closed pattern." perhaps" stands in place of commitment. at the same time, he is plainly sympathetic, clearly friendly. if there were only the mess, all would be clear;; but there is also compassion. as a christian, i know i do not stand where beckett stands, but i do see much of what he sees. as a writer on the theater, i have paid close attention to the plays. harold clurman is right to say that" waiting for godot" is a reflection  he calls it a distorted reflection " of the impasse and disarray of europe's present politics, ethic, and common way of life". yet it is not only europe the play refers to." waiting for godot" sells even better in america than in france. the consciousness it mirrors may have come earlier to europe than to america, but it is the consciousness that most" mature" societies arrive at when their successes in technological and economic systematization propel them into a time of examining the notstrictlypractical ends of culture. america is now joining europe in this" mature" phase of development. whether any of us remain in it long will depend on what happens as a result of the technological and economic revolutions now going on in the countries of asia and africa, and also of course on how long the cold war remains cold. to meek submission: thou, at season fit, diameter of eighty thousand miles, 27:1

address he will deliver tomorrow night to the american people over nationwide television and radio. the president spent much of the weekend at his summer home on cape cod writing the first drafts of portions of the address with the help of white house aids in washington with whom he talked by telephone. shortly after the chief executive returned to washington in midmorning from hyannis port, mass., a white house spokesman said the address text still had" quite a way to go" toward completion. decisions are made asked to elaborate, pierre salinger, white house press secretary, replied," i would say it is got to go thru several more drafts". salinger said the work president kennedy, advisers, and members of his staff were doing on the address involved composition and wording, rather than last minute decisions on administration plans to meet the latest berlin crisis precipitated by russia's demands and proposals for the city. the last 10 cases in the investigation of the nov. 8 election were dismissed yesterday by acting judge john m. karns, who charged that the prosecution obtained evidence" by unfair and fundamentally illegal means". karns said that the cases involved a matter" of even greater significance than the guilt or innocence" of the 50 persons. he said evidence was obtained" in violation of the legal rights of citizens". karns" ruling pertained to eight of the 10 cases. in the two other cases he ruled that the state had been" unable to make a case". contempt proceedings originally had been brought against 677 persons in 133 precincts by morris j. wexler, special prosecutor. issue jury subpoenas wexler admitted in earlier court hearings that he issued grand jury subpenas to about 200 persons involved in the election investigation, questioned the individuals in the criminal courts building, but did not take them before the grand jury. mayer goldberg, attorney for election judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward, argued this procedure constituted intimidation. wexler has denied repeatedly that coercion was used in questioning. karns said it was a" wrongful act" for wexler to take statements" privately and outside of the grand jury room". he said this constituted a" very serious misuse" of the criminal court processes." actually, the abuse of the process may have constituted a contempt of the criminal court of cook county, altho vindication of the authority of that court is not the function of this court", said karns, who is a city judge in east st. louis sitting in cook county court. faced seven cases karns had been scheduled this week to hear seven cases involving 35 persons. wexler had charged the precinct judges in these cases with" complementary" miscount of the vote, in which votes would be taken from one candidate and given to another. the cases involved judges in the 33d, 24th, and 42d precincts of the 31st ward, the 21st and 28th precincts of the 29th ward, the 18th precinct of the 4th ward, and the 9th precinct of the 23d ward. the case of the judges in the 58th precinct of the 23d ward had been heard previously and taken under advisement by karns. two other cases also were under advisement. claims precedent lacking after reading his statement discharging the 23d ward case, karns told wexler that if the seven cases scheduled for trial also involved persons who had been subpenaed, he would dismiss them. washington, feb. 9  president kennedy today proposed a mammoth new medical care program whereby social security taxes on 70 million american workers would be raised to pay the hospital and some other medical bills of 14.2 million americans over 65 who are covered by social security or railroad retirement programs. the president, in a special message to congress, tied in with his aged care plan requests for large federal grants to finance medical and dental scholarships, build 20 new medical and 20 new dental schools, and expand child health care and general medical research. the aged care plan, similar to one the president sponsored last year as a senator, a fight on capitol hill. it was defeated in congress last year. cost up to 37 a year it would be financed by boosting the social security payroll tax by as much as 37 a year for each of the workers now paying such taxes. the social security payroll tax is now 6 per cent  3 per cent on each worker and employer  on the first 4,800 of pay per year. the kennedy plan alone would boost the base to 5,000 a year and the payroll tax to 6.5 per cent  3.25 per cent each. similar payroll tax boosts would be imposed on those under the railroad retirement system. the payroll tax would actually rise to 7.5 per cent starting jan. 1, 1963, if the plan is approved, because the levy is already scheduled to go up by 1 per cent on that date to pay for other social security costs. outlays would increase officials estimated the annual tax boost for the medical plan would amount to 1.5 billion dollars and that medical benefits paid out would run 1 billion or more in the first year, 1963. both figures would go higher in later years. other parts of the kennedy health plan would entail federal grants of 750 million to 1 billion dollars over the next 10 years. these would be paid for out of general, not payroll, taxes. nursing home care the aged care plan carries these benefits for persons over 65 who are under the social security and railroad retirement systems: 1 full payment of hospital bills for stays up to 90 days for each illness, except that the patient would pay 10 a day of the cost for the first nine days. 2 full payment of nursing home bills for up to 180 days following discharge from a hospital. a patient could receive up to 300 days paidfor nursing home care under a" unit formula" allowing more of such care for those who use none or only part of the hospitalcare credit. 3 hospital outpatient clinic diagnostic service for all costs in excess of 20 a patient. 4 community visiting nurse services at home for up to 240 days an illness. the president noted that congress last year passed a law providing grants to states to help pay medical bills of the needy aged. calls proposal modest he said his plan is designed to" meet the needs of those millions who have no wish to receive care at the taxpayers" expense, but who are nevertheless staggered by the drain on their savings  or those of their children  caused by an extended hospital stay"." this is a very modest proposal cut to meet absolutely essential needs", he said," and with sufficient" deductible" requirements to discourage any malingering or unnecessary overcrowding of our hospitals." this is not a program of socialized medicine. it is a program of prepayment of health costs with absolute freedom of choice guaranteed. every person will choose his own doctor and hospital". would not pay doctors the plan does not cover doctor bills. they would still be paid by the patient. apart from the aged care plan the president's most ambitious and costly proposals were for federal scholarships, and grants to build or enlarge medical and dental schools. the president said the nation's 92 medical and 47 dental schools cannot now handle the student load needed to meet the rising need for health care. moreover, he said, many qualified young people are not going into medicine and dentistry because they cannot afford the schooling costs. contributions to schools the scholarship plan would provide federal contributions to each medical and dental school equal to 1,500 a year for onefourth of the first year students. the schools could use the money to pay 4year scholarships, based on need, of up to 2,000 a year per student. in addition, the government would pay a 1,000" cost of education" grant to the schools for each 1,500 in scholarship grants. officials estimated the combined programs would cost 5.1 million dollars the first year and would go up to 21 millions by 1966. the president recommended federal" matching grants" totaling 700 million dollars in 10 years for constructing new medical and dental schools or enlarging the capacity of existing ones. more for nursing homes in the area of" community health services", the president called for doubling the present 10 million dollar a year federal grants for nursing home construction. he asked for another 10 million dollar" initial" appropriation for" stimulatory grants" to states to improve nursing homes. he further proposed grants of an unspecified sum for experimental hospitals. in the child health field, the president said he will recommend later an increase in funds for programs under the children's bureau. he also asked congress to approve establishment of a national child health institute. asks research funds the president said he will ask congress to increase grants to states for vocational rehabilitation. he did not say by how much. for medical research he asked a 20 million dollar a year increase, from 30 to 50 millions, in matching grants for building research facilities. the president said he will also propose increasing, by an unspecified amount, the 540 million dollars in the 196162 budget for direct government research in medicine. the president said his proposals combine the" indispensable elements in a sound health program  people, knowledge, services, facilities, and the means to pay for them". reaction as expected congressional reaction to the message was along expected lines. legislators who last year opposed placing agedcare under the social security system criticized the president's plan. those who backed a similar plan last year hailed the message. senate republican leader dirksen  ill.  and house republican leader charles halleck  ind.  said the message did not persuade them to change their opposition to compulsory medical insurance. halleck said the voluntary care plan enacted last year should be given a fair trial first. house speaker sam rayburn  d., tex.  called the kennedy program" a mighty fine thing", but made no prediction on its fate in the house. washington, feb. 9  acting hastily under white house pressure, the senate tonight confirmed robert c. weaver as the nation's federal housing chief. only 11 senators were on the floor and there was no record vote. a number of scattered" ayes" and" noes" was heard. customary senate rules were ignored in order to speed approval of the negro leader as administrator of the housing and home finance agency. in the last eight years, all presidential appointments, including those of cabinet rank, have been denied immediate action because of a senate rule requiring at least a 24 hour delay after they are reported to the floor. enforce by demand the rule was enforced by demand of sen. wayne morse  d., ore.  in connection with president eisenhower's cabinet selections in 1953 and president kennedy's in 1961."well, perhaps you have not found it so yet," said alice;"but when you i haue an houres

from jane's countenance that she their part, and repeated promises of secrecy on his, they at length condition of curious hilarity. his spirits were already upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and the priest shall make beene a gentlewoman, shee should haue beene buried dan morgan told himself he would forget ann turner. he was well rid of her. he certainly did not want a wife who was fickle as ann. if he had married her, he would have been asking for trouble. but all of this was rationalization. sometimes he woke up in the middle of the night thinking of ann, and then could not get back to sleep. his plans and dreams had revolved around her so much and for so long that now he felt as if he had nothing. the easiest thing would be to sell out to al budd and leave the country, but there was a stubborn streak in him that would not allow it. the best antidote for the bitterness and disappointment that poisoned him was hard work. he found that if he was tired enough at night, he went to sleep simply because he was too exhausted to stay awake. each day he found himself thinking less often of ann;; each day the hurt was a little duller, a little less poignant. he had plenty of work to do. because the summer was unusually dry and hot, the spring produced a smaller stream than in ordinary years. the grass in the meadows came fast, now that the warm weather was here. he could not afford to lose a drop of the precious water, so he spent most of his waking hours along the ditches in his meadows. he had no idea how much time budd would give him. in any case, he had no intention of being caught asleep, so he carried his revolver in its holster on his hip and he took his winchester with him and leaned it against the fence. he stopped every few minutes and leaned on his shovel as he studied the horizon, but nothing happened, each day dragging out with monotonous calm. when, in late afternoon on the last day in june, he saw two people top the ridge to the south and walk toward the house, he quit work immediately and strode to his rifle. it could be some kind of trick budd had thought up. no one walked in this country, least of all ed dow or dutch renfro or any of the rest of the bar b crew. morgan watched the two figures for a time, puzzled. when they were closer and he saw that one was a woman, he was more puzzled than ever. he cleaned his shovel, left it against the fence, picked up his winchester, and started downstream. his visitors had crawled through the south fence and were crossing the meadow, angling toward the house. now he saw that both the man and woman were moving slowly and irregularly, staggering, as if they found it a struggle to remain on their feet. reaching the house ahead of them, he waited with his winchester in his hands. they crawled through the north fence and came on toward him, and now he saw that both were young, not more than nineteen or twenty. they were dirty, their clothes were torn, and the girl was so exhausted that she fell when she was still twenty feet from the front door. she lay there, making no effort to get back on her feet. the boy came on to the porch and sat down, his gaze on morgan as if half expecting him to shoot and not really caring. morgan hesitated, thinking that if this was a trick, it was a good one. he did not think it was possible for this couple to be pretending. the boy licked his dry lips. he asked," could we have a drink"?? morgan jerked his head toward the front door." in the kitchen", he said. leaning his winchester against the front of the house, he walked to the girl." get up. there is water in the house". she did not move or say anything. her eyes were glazed as if she did not hear or even see him. she had reached a point at which she did not even care how she looked. her face was very thin, and burned by the sun until much of the skin was dead and peeling, the new skin under it red and angry. her blond hair was frowzy, her dress torn in several places, and her shoes were so completely worn out that they were practically no protection. it must have hurt her even to walk, for the sole was completely off her left foot and morgan saw that it was bruised and bleeding. he picked her up, sliding one hand under her shoulders, the other under her knees, and carried her into the house. she was amazingly light, and so relaxed in his arms that he was not even sure she was conscious. any lingering suspicion that this was a trick al budd had thought up was dispelled. no girl would go this far to fool a man so she could kill him. besides, she had a sweet face that attracted him. he put her down on the couch, and going into the kitchen, saw that the boy had dropped into a chair beside the table. they looked a good deal alike, morgan thought. both had blonde hair and blue eyes, and there was even a faint similarity of features. morgan filled the dipper from the water bucket on the shelf, went back into the front room, lifted the girl's head, and held the edge of the dipper to her mouth. she drank greedily, and murmured," thank you", as he lowered her head. he stood looking down at her for a moment, wondering what could have reduced her to this condition. he had seen a few nester wagons go through the country, the families almost starving to death, but he had never seen any of them on foot and as bad off as these two. the girl dropped off to sleep. morgan returned to the kitchen, built a fire, and carried in several buckets of water from the spring which he poured into the copper boiler that he had placed on the stove. he brought his winchester in from the front of the house, then faced the boy." who are you and what happened to you"?? he asked." i am billy jones", the boy answered." that is my wife sharon. we ran out of money and we have not eaten for two days"." what are you doing here"??" are we in wyoming"?? morgan nodded." about five miles north of the line". jones sighed as if relieved." we have been looking for work, but all the ranchers have turned us down"." you mean you dragged your wife all over hell's halfacre looking for work"?? morgan demanded." the town of buckhorn's only about six miles from here. why did not you go there"??" we did not want town work", jones said." this is a mighty empty country", morgan said." there is only one more ranch three miles north of here. you would have starved to death if you would missed both places"." then we are lucky we got here. could you give us a job, mr."" morgan. dan morgan". he was silent a moment, thinking he could use a man this time of year, and if the girl could cook, it would give him more time in the meadows, but he knew nothing about the couple. they might kill him in his sleep, thinking there was money in the house. he dismissed the possibility at once. the girl's thin face haunted him. it was not the face of a killer. he was not so sure about the boy. he had not shaved for several weeks, his sparse beard giving his face a pathetic, woebegone expression. there was more to this than jones had told him. they were running from something. he would be an idiot to let them stay he thought, but he could not send them on, either." i could use some help", morgan said finally," but i cannot afford to pay you anything. i guess you would better go on in the morning"." we will work for our keep", the boy said eagerly." i have been mucking in a mine in the san juan, but i used to work on a ranch. sharon, she is cooked in a restaurant. we will work hard, mr. morgan"." i will see", morgan said." right now you need a meal and a bath. your wife's in terrible shape"." i know", jones said dejectedly. morgan filled the fire box with wood again, then started supper and set the table. when the meal was ready, he told jones to wash up, and going into the front room, woke the girl. he said," i have got some supper ready". she rubbed her eyes and stretched, then sat up, her hands going to her hair." i am a mess", she said, and suddenly she was alarmed." who are you?? how did we get here"??" i am dan morgan. this is the rafter aj. you fell down in front of the house, and i carried you in. i gave you a drink and then you went to sleep"." oh". she stared at him, her eyes wide as she thought about what he had said;; then she murmured:" you are very kind, mr. morgan. do you take in all the strays who come by"??" i do not have many strays coming to my front door", he said." think you can walk to the table"??" of course". she got to her feet, staggered, and almost fell. he caught her by an arm and helped her into the kitchen. she sat down at the table, shaking her head." i am sorry, mr. morgan. i am usually a very strong woman, but i am awfully tired"." and hungry", he said." start in. it is not much of a meal, but it is what i eat"." not much of a meal"?? the girl cried." mr. morgan, it is the bestlooking food i ever saw". he told himself he had never seen two people eat so much. when they were finally satisfied, jones said," i think he is going to give us work". the grateful way she looked at morgan made him ashamed of himself. when he saw the expression in her eyes, he knew he could not send them on. she said," i guess the lord looks out for fools, drunkards, and innocents". morgan laughed." which are you"??" we are not drunkards", she said." that is all i am sure of". she helped him with the dishes, then he brought more water in from the spring before it got dark. he carried the tub from the back of the house where it hung from a nail in the wall. he said:" you will feel a lot better after you have a bath. your feet are in bad shape, mrs. jones. you will have to go to town to see the doc"." no, she will be all right", jones said quickly." i mean, we do not have any way to get there and we cannot expect you to quit work just to take us to town"." we will see", morgan said." could you find me a needle and thread"?? the girl asked." my dress needs some work on it". he nodded and, going into the bedroom, brought a needle, thread, and scissors. he said:" i am going to bed". he nodded at the door in front of him." that is my spare bedroom. the bed is not made, but you will find plenty of blankets there"." you are awfully kind", the girl said." we will pay you back if you will let us. some way"." it is all right", he said." i get up early. you would better sleep". jones followed him into the front room, closing the door behind him. he said:" if it is all right with you, mr. morgan, i will sleep out here on the couch. we have not slept together since we started. i just cannot take any chances on getting her pregnant, and if we were sleeping together" he stopped, embarrassed, and morgan said," i understand that, but i do not savvy why you would go off and leave your jobs in the first place"." we got fired", jones said." we had to do something". they were a pair of lost, whipped kids, morgan thought as he went to bed. to find

servant with the sword. contrived to find his way back to bed, he could by no means undress as a result, although we still make use of this distinction, there is much confusion as to the meaning of the basic terms employed. just what is meant by" spirit" and by" matter"?? the terms are generally taken for granted as though they referred to direct and axiomatic elements in the common experience of all. yet in the contemporary context this is precisely what one must not do. for in the modern world neither" spirit" nor" matter" refer to any generally agreedupon elements of experience. we are in a transitional stage in which many of the connotations of former usage have had to be revised or rejected. when the words are used, we are never sure which of the traditional meanings the user may have in mind, or to what extent his revisions and rejections of former understandings correspond to ours. one of the most widespread features of contemporary thought is the almost universal disbelief in the reality of spirit. just a few centuries ago the world of spirits was as populous and real as the world of material entities. not only in popular thought but in that of the highly educated as well was this true. demons, fairies, angels, and a host of other spiritual beings were as much a part of the experiential world of western man as were rocks and trees and stars. in such a world the words" matter" and" spirit" both referred to directly known realities in the common experience of all. in it important elements of christianity and of the biblical view of reality in general, which now cause us much difficulty, could be responded to quite naturally and spontaneously. the progress of science over these last few centuries and the gradual replacement of biblical by scientific categories of reality have to a large extent emptied the spirit world of the entities which previously populated it. in carrying out this program science has undoubtedly performed a very considerable service for which it can claim due credit. the objectification of the world of spirit in popular superstition had certainly gone far beyond what the experience of spirit could justify or support. science is fully competent to deal with any element of experience which arises from an object in space and time. when, therefore, it turned its attention to the concrete entities with which popular imagination had peopled the world of spirit, these entities soon lost whatever status they had enjoyed as actual elements of external reality. in doing so science has unquestionably cleared up widespread misconceptions, removed extraneous and illusory sources of fear, and dispelled many undesirable popular superstitions. there have been, indeed, many important and valuable gains from the development of our present scientific view of the world for which we may be rightly grateful. all this has not, however, been an unmixed blessing. the scientific debunking of the spirit world has been in a way too successful and too thorough. the house has been swept so clean that contemporary man has been left with no means, or at best with wholly inadequate means, for dealing with his experience of spirit. although the particular form of conceptualization which popular imagination had made in response to the experience of spirit was undoubtedly defective, the raw experience itself which led to such excesses remains with us as vividly as ever. we simply find ourselves in the position of having no means for inquiring into the structure and meaning of this range of our experience. there is no framework or structure of thought with respect to which we can organize it and no part of reality, as we know and apprehend it, with respect to which we can refer this experience. science has simply left us helpless and powerless in this important sector of our lives. the situation in which we find ourselves is brought out with dramatic force in arthur miller's play the crucible, which deals with the salem witch trials. as the play opens the audience is introduced to the community of salem in puritan america at the end of the eighteenth century. aside from a quaint concern with witches and devils which provides the immediate problem in the opening scene, it is a quite normal community. the conversation of the characters creates an atmosphere suggesting the usual mixture of pleasures, foibles, irritations, and concerns which would characterize the common life of a normal village in any age. there is no occasion to feel uneasy or disturbed about these people. instead, the audience can sit back at ease and, from the perspective of an enlightened time which no longer believes in such things, enjoy the dead seriousness with which the characters in the play take the witches and devils which are under discussion. a teenage girl, abigail williams, is being sharply questioned by her minister uncle, the reverend samuel parris, about a wild night affair in the woods in which she and some other girls had seemed to have had contact with these evil beings. for all involved in this discussion the devil is a real entity who can really be confronted in the woods on a dark night, the demon world is populated with real creatures, and witches actually can be seen flying through the air. as the play unfolds, however, the audience is subtly brought into the grip of an awful evil which grows with ominously gathering power and soon engulfs the community. everyone in salem, saint and sinner alike, is swept up by it. it is like a mysterious epidemic which, starting first with abigail and parris, spreads inexorably with a dreadfully growing virulence through the whole town until all have been infected by it. it grows terribly and unavoidably in power and leaves in its wake a trail of misery, moral disintegration, and destruction. the audience leaves the play under a spell, it is the kind of spell which the exposure to spirit in its living active manifestation always evokes. if one asks about this play, what it is that comes upon this community and works within it with such terrible power, there is no better answer to give than" spirit". this is not to attempt to say what spirit is, but only to employ a commonly used word to designate or simply identify a common experience. in the end the good man, john proctor, expresses what the audience has already come to feel when he says," a fire, a fire is burning!! i hear the boot of lucifer, i see his filthy face"!! the tragic irony of the play is that the very belief in and concern with a devil who could be met in the woods and combatted with formulae set out in books was the very thing that prevented them from detecting the real devil when he came among them. we marvel at their blindness for not seeing this. yet are not we of the midtwentieth century, who rightly do not believe there is any such" thing" as the devil, just as bad off as they  only in a different way?? in our disbelief we think that we can no longer even use the word and so are unable to even name the elemental power which is so vividly real in this play. we are left helpless to cope with it because we do not dare speak of it as anything real for fear that to do so would imply a commitment to that which has already been discredited and proved false. even mr. miller himself seems uncertain on this score. in a long commentary which he has inserted in the published text of the first act of the play, he says at one point:" however, that experience never raised a doubt in his mind as to the reality of the underworld or the existence of lucifer's manyfaced lieutenants. and his belief is not to his discredit. better minds than hale's were  and still are  convinced that there is a society of spirits beyond our ken".  page 33  on the other hand, a little later on he says:" since 1692 a great but superficial change has wiped out god's beard and the devil's horns, but the world is still gripped between two diametrically opposed absolutes. the concept of unity, in which positive and negative are attributes of the same force, in which good and evil are relative, everchanging, and always joined to the same phenomenon  such a concept is still reserved to the physical sciences and to the few who have grasped the history of ideas. when we see the steady and methodical inculcation into humanity of the idea of man's worthlessness  until redeemed  the necessity of the devil may become evident as a weapon, a weapon designed and used time and time again in every age to whip men into a surrender to a particular church or churchstate".  page 34  apparently he does not intend that those who read or view this play should think of the devil as being actually real. yet such is the dramatic power of his writing that the audience is nevertheless left in the grip of the terrible power and potency of that which came over salem. it casts a spell upon them so that they leave with a feeling of having been in the mysterious presence of an evil power. it is not enough in accounting for this feeling to analyze it into the wickedness of individual people added together to produce a cumulative effect. for this does not account for the integral, elemental power of that which grows with abounding vigor as the play unfolds, nor does it explain the strange numinous sense of presentness which comes over those who watch the play like a spell. the reality of spirit emerges in this play in spite of the author's convictions to the contrary. spirit and community there is nothing in the whole range of human experience more widely known and universally felt than spirit. apart from spirit there could be no community, for it is spirit which draws men into community and gives to any community its unity, cohesiveness, and permanence. think, for example, of the spirit of the marine corps. surely this is a reality we all acknowledge. we cannot, of course, assign it any substance. it is not material and is not a" thing" occupying space and time. yet it exists and has an objective reality which can be experienced and known. so it is too with many other spirits which we all know: the spirit of nazism or communism, school spirit, the spirit of a street corner gang or a football team, the spirit of rotary or the ku klux klan. every community, if it is alive has a spirit, and that spirit is the center of its unity and identity. in searching for clues which might lead us to a fresh apprehension of the reality of spirit, the close connection between spirit and community is likely to prove the most fruitful. for it is primarily in community that we know and experience spirit. it is spirit which gives life to a community and causes it to cohere. it is the spirit which is the source of a community's drawing power by means of which others are drawn into it from the world outside so that the community grows and prospers. yet the spirit which lives in community is not identical with the community. the idea of community and the idea of spirit are two distinct and separable ideas. one characteristic of the spirit in community is its givenness. the members of the community do not create the spirit but rather find it present and waiting for them. it is for them a given which they and they alone possess. the spirit of the marine corps was present and operative before any of the present members of it came into it. it is they, of course, who keep it alive and preserve it so the same spirit will continue to be present in the corps for future recruits to find as they come into it. is by the entry of the east gate, and proclaim there the words that i when all preliminaries were over and peleg had got everything ready that we may so suffice

herself to the ground, the vast central valley of california is one of the most productive agricultural areas in the world. during the summer of 1960, it became the setting for a bitter and basic labormanagement struggle. the contestants in this economic struggle are the agricultural workers organizing committee  awoc  of the aflcio and the agricultural employers of the state. by virtue of the legal responsibilities of the department of employment in the farm placement program, we necessarily found ourselves in the middle between these two forces. it is not a pleasant or easy position, but one we have endeavored to maintain. we have sought to be strictly neutral as between the parties, but at the same time we have been required frequently to rule on specific issues or situations as they arose. inevitably, one side was pleased and the other displeased, regardless of how we ruled. often the displeased parties interpreted our decision as implying favoritism toward the other. we have consoled ourselves with the thought that this is a normal human reaction and is one of the consequences of any decision in an adversary proceeding. it is disconcerting, nevertheless, to read in a labor weekly," perluss knuckles down to growers", and then to be confronted with a growers" publication which states," perluss recognizes obviously phony and trumpedup strikes as bona fide". for a number of years, there have been sporadic attempts in california to organize farm workers. these attempts met with little sucess for a variety of reasons. they were inadequately financed, without experienced leadership, and lacked the general support of organized labor as a whole. this past year the pattern has been different: the organizing program had the full support of the aflcio, which supplied staff and money to the awoc, as well as moral support. leadership was experienced and skillful, and financial resources were significant. regardless of where personal sympathies may lie as between the parties, failure to recognize these changed conditions would be to ignore the facts of life. as a result of these changed conditions, the impact of the organizational effort on agricultural labormanagement relations has been much greater than in the past. the awoc has been able to employ the traditional weapons of labor  the strike and the picket line  with considerable success, particularly in the area of wages. by the very nature of the situation, it is the union which has been able to select the time and place to bring pressure upon management. to date, at least, the strategy of the awoc has been selective;; that is to say, to concentrate on a particular crop or activity in a particular area at a strategic time, rather than any broadside engagement with management throughout an area or the state. primarily, we became involved in these disputes because of our referral obligations under our farm placement program. normally, because agricultural labor is not covered by unemployment insurance, we would not expect any issues to arise regarding benefit payments under the trade dispute provision of the unemployment insurance code, although such a situation is quite within the realm of possibility. but the current issues arose out of the wagnerpeyser act concerning referrals to an establishment where a labor dispute exists, and out of public law 78 and the migrant labor agreement if mexican nationals were employed at the ranch. most of us remember and think of the wagnerpeyser act in its historical sense, as a major milestone in the development of public placement services. infrequently do we think of it as a living, continuing, operating control over the system. however, when labor disputes arise, its provisions come clearly into play. california has accepted the provisions of that act  as have all other states  by enacting into our code  section 2051  a provision that the state of california accepts the provisions of the wagnerpeyser act, and will observe and comply with the requirements of that act. with respect to labor disputes, the wagnerpeyser act states only, in carrying out the provisions of this act, the secretary is authorized and directed to provide for the giving of notice of strikes or lockouts to applicants before they are referred to employment. other provisions of the act empower the secretary to adopt regulations necessary to carry out its provisions, and he has done so. the pertinent regulation for our purposes is section 602.2 , , as follows: referrals in labor dispute situations. no person shall be referred to a position the filling of which will aid directly or indirectly in filling a job which  1  is vacant because the former occupant is on strike or is being locked out in the course of a labor dispute, or  2  the filling of which is an issue in a labor dispute. with respect to positions not covered by subparagraph  1  or  2  of this paragraph, any individual may be referred to a place of employment in which a labor dispute exists, provided he is given written notice of such dispute prior to or at the time of his referral. in analyzing this regulation, let us take the last sentence first. it permits referrals under certain circumstances even when there is a labor dispute, provided the individual is given written notice of such a dispute. assume, for example, a situation where a farm has a packing shed and fields. the packing shed workers go on strike. there is no dispute involving fieldwork. we concluded that we may refer workers to the fieldwork  but not the packing shed work  provided we give them written notice of the packing shed dispute. so far, no troublesome cases have arisen under this provision. it is the first part of the regulation that is currently at issue. note that it prohibits referrals under either condition  1  or condition  2 . employer representatives have contended that the secretary has gone beyond his authority by such a prohibition, on the grounds that the wagnerpeyser act requires only written notice to the prospective worker that a dispute exists. into court the matter got into the courts this way: one of the early strikes called by the awoc was at the digiorgio pear orchards in yuba county. we found that a labor dispute existed, and that the workers had left their jobs, which were then vacant because of the dispute. accordingly, under clause  1  of the secretary's regulation, we suspended referrals to the employer.  incidentally, no mexican nationals were involved.  the employer, seeking to continue his harvest, challenged our right to cease referrals to him, and sought relief in the superior court of yuba county. the court issued a temporary restraining order, directing us to resume referrals. we, of course, obeyed the court order. however, the attorney general of california, at the request of the secretary of labor, sought to have the jurisdiction over the issue removed to the federal district court, on grounds that it was predominantly a federal issue since the validity of the secretary's regulation was being challenged. however, the federal court held that since the state had accepted the provisions of the wagnerpeyser act into its own code, and presumably therefore also the regulations, it was now a state matter. it accordingly refused to assume jurisdiction, whereupon the california superior court made the restraining order permanent. under that order, we have continued referring workers to the ranch. a similar case arose at the bowers ranch in butte county, and the superior court of that county issued similar restraining orders. the growers have strenuously argued that i should have accepted the superior court decisions as conclusive and issued statewide instructions to our staff to ignore this provision in the secretary's regulation. i cannot accept that view, either as a lawyer or as an administrator. legal considerations first, let us examine briefly some of the legal considerations involved. it is an accepted juridical principle in california that a superior court decision does not constitute a binding legal precedent. it is conclusive, unless appealed, only upon the particular parties to the particular action which was heard. it is not binding upon another superior court, which could rule to the contrary. only when a decision is rendered by the district court of appeal  or, of course, the supreme court  is a binding precedent established. in that event, we can correctly say that we have received an authoritative interpretation of the matter, and one which we can follow statewide with confidence that the policy will not be overthrown in other superior courts. but over and beyond the compelling need for a binding precedent decision, i am convinced that the decisions of the superior courts which in effect nullify the secretary's regulation are not a correct interpretation of the secretary's power under the federal law. i believe i am in good company in this view. the attorney general of california concurs in this interpretation and has filed an appeal from these decisions to the district court of appeal. the attorney general of the united states, in considering the power of the secretary to issue similar regulations under the wagnerpeyser act relating to the interstate recruitment of farm workers, has rendered an opinion sustaining his authority. further, and as an evidence of legislative intent only, the senate of the united states recently defeated by a substantial majority the" holland amendment" to the fair labor standards act, which would have specifically limited the regulatory authority of the secretary in these matters. next, let us consider briefly the program and administrative implications of a failure on our part to pursue our appeals. there is far too much at stake for all of the parties concerned to leave the matter hanging in midair. the ramifications of the issue are enormous. a decision to refer workers to jobs vacant because of a strike would have to be applied equally to nonagricultural situations, and might in effect place the public employment services in the position of acting as strikebreakers. the public interest is so dominant in such an issue that i cannot be so presumptuous as to attempt to settle it by an administrative order based upon conclusions reached in a summary action in one or two superior courts in the state. it is an issue which may well reach the supreme court of the united states before judicial finality is achieved. as an administrator, i cannot place the employment service in california in jeopardy of being out of compliance with the federal laws by my failure to pursue the avenues of appeal open to me. to have applied statewide the decisions of the two cases heard in superior court, in my opinion, would have placed us clearly out of compliance with the wagnerpeyser act and would have immediately opened the way for the secretary of labor, were he so inclined, to notify the governor of such noncompliance, set a date for hearing, and issue his finding. the impact of noncompliance under the wagnerpeyser act is clear: the withdrawal of some 11 million a year of administrative funds which finance our employment service program or, as a corollary, the taking over by the federal government of its operation. thus far, the cases which have come before the courts have involved only the issue of referral where the job is vacant due to a strike  condition  1  in the regulation of the secretary. none has yet arisen under condition  2 , relating to referral to jobs" the filling of which is an issue in a labor dispute". here the problem is essentially one of defining the word" filling". should it be defined in a narrow sense to include only such elements as job specifications, union membership, union jurisdiction, and the like?? or should it have a broader connotation of including wage demands and other factors not necessarily associated with the mechanics of" filling" the job. because of the uncertainty of this definition, i solicited the interpretation of the secretary of labor. he has advised me that the narrower interpretation is the proper one;; that is, that if wages, for example, is the only issue in a labor dispute, and no workers have left their jobs because of the dispute, we may continue to make referrals. strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power: 49:4 no greater burden than these necessary things; 15:29 that ye
